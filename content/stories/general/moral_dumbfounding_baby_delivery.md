In a sterile, fluorescent-lit delivery room, a husband grasps his wife's trembling hand. "One more push, honey. You're almost there!"

She breathes in sharp, shallow bursts. "I know the name!" She exhales. "I know the name for the baby!"

He caresses her cheek and smiles. "Tell me."

She grimace-grunts through the final push. "Aella!"

The husband's face drops. "What?"

The naked infant pops out into the doctor's waiting hands.

"POLL TIME!" Baby Aella declares. "While playing in the street, Bingo gets hit by a car and dies. Bandit takes the body behind the house, butchers her for primal cuts, cooks it all on the grill, and serves the savory meat on brioche buns. Bluey takes a bite and says 'Hot dog, this is good!' Is this wrong?"

"Oh that's a tough one," the exhausted wife says.

The doctor nods. "A real almond activator."

"Honey, what do you thinâ€”"

"Put it back!" The husband cries. "PUT IT BACK!"
