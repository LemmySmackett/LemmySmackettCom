You are on this council," the Grand-Jester decreed. "But we do not grant you the rank of Court Jester."

"What?" Anakin's skirt bells jingled with indignation. "How can you do this? This is outrageous! It's unfair!"

"Unfair! Unfair!" The other jesters squawked as they somersaulted from their chairs and tumbled about the room, cavorting like mad baboons.

Anakin clenched his fist as a particularly annoying fool skulked up and struck his bottom like a bongo. "Outrageous!" The fool mimicked with mocking glee.

Anakin stood there, silently enduring the beating of the cheeks. They would all take him seriously soon enough, he swore. 

The last laugh would be his.
