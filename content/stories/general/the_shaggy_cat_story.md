Once, I had this boss. An absolute bastard of a man. I'm talking an unholy cross between Michael Scott and Terence Fletcher. You know, the guy from Whiplash? "Not my tempo." Anyway, my boss' name was Dan Dale, and working for him was the worst three months of my life. 

But this story isn't about that. A couple of decades back, years before I ever had the misfortune of being under his employ, Dan went into a business with a local pastor. Some realty thing.

Now the pastor was planning to cut ties. Go his own God-given way. Partly because business was bad. Partly because Dan was such an asshole. But the story isn't about that. You see, the pastor had a wife. And the wife had a cat. 

Now the cat was the wife's pride and joy—a beautiful Himalayan with a luxurious silk-soft coat. A pedigreed purebred registered with the American Cat Fanciers' Association. The wife loved this damn cat. Pampered it to hell. I'm talking grilled salmon from the can, a multi-level faux fur tower with condos, ramps, and sisal rope, and a plug-in electric heated bed. Yes, this pussy was a prince. And the prince was picky. 

Nice as it was, the prince didn't sleep in his heated bed. It turned out fleece-lined wasn't good enough for this feline. No, the prince preferred to sleep in the giant metal condo his two-legged servants kept in the utility room. That's right. The cat took all his naps in the dryer. 

Week after week, the wife did the laundry—diligently cleansing the clergyman's clothes—and the cat slept in the rumpled pile of cozy-warm linens while she toiled. 

Yeah, you know where this is going.

One day, the inevitable happened. The wife rolled up with a basket of the pastor's sweat-stained unmentionables—he was the fire-and-brimstone type, after all—loaded up the dryer, shut the door, turned the knob, and walked away. She didn't think nothing of the rhythmic thumping sound banging around in the drum. Hell, who does?

How'd the cat get in there? Maybe it jumped in when she wasn't looking. Maybe it'd been in there all along. The question that boggles my mind: Why didn't it scream? 

What happened when the cycle ended and the wife went to retrieve those crisp, clean whites fit for a Man of the Cloth? She did scream and to high hell, of course. She bawled her eyes out, rang up her holy hubbie, and bawled some more. God had dealt a cruel and grievous hand, as he often does.

Dan was standing next to the pastor when he got the call. The pastor relayed the grim news and Dan just nodded. My boss didn't say one word about it. 

Until the very next week, when all three met at a café. The pastor intended to deliver an ultimatum: their time as business partners was through and, like King Solomon's baby, he was looking to split it all down the line—fair as fair, fifty-fifty. The wife, for her part, came dressed in black, head to toe, still in mourning for the dearly departed domestic long-hair.

Dan walked right up to the couple, took one look at the wife, grinned wide and said, "Hey, I heard your cat dried."
