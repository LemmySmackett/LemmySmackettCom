Hey, man. How was your Thanksgiving?"

"Eh, it was alright. My Dad's been battling prostate cancer all year and the doctors say he won't make it to Christmas. But at least we all got to spend one last—"

"Mine was great. Wanna see my family photo?"

[sigh] "No, not really. I barely consider you an acquaintance and showing off family photos is kinda cringe—"

"Here it is!"

"Lovely."

"This is my Grandpa Jonathan, my Grandma Jolyne, my uncle Joseph, his gay lover Giorno, my cousin Johnny—"

"What in the name of Hirohiko Araki?"

"My aunt Jolene and her dog Dolly. Ah, and my three nephews: Huey, Dewey, and Jotaro."

"Couldn't commit on that last one, huh?"

"Yeah, my aunt Jolene just loves Donald Duck."

"No, I mean—never mind. It's a very nice photo; your family looks great."

"Funny thing. Huey and Dewey wouldn't stand still, so I had to take multiple shots and let Gemini merge them together."

"Oh. This isn't a real picture?"

"Huh?"

"It's so life-like."

"Of course it's a real picture, dude. It's my family."

"Right, but I mean like, this exact moment didn't happen."

"Of course it happened. We all stood together and took a picture."

"Okay, but this photo doesn't ontologically capture the familial historicity of—you know what, fuck it."

"Anyway, that was last year's photo. Here's this year's!"

"Wait, why did you show me last year's? And why are there twice as many people in this one?"

"Ah well, a lot happens in a year, you know? Giorno left my Uncle Joseph, which caused him to give up on life and disappear to San Francisco—"

"Uh."

"—where he now roams the streets and back alleys as a toothless, disheveled drug addict with his own #methlife podcast."

"Grim."

"He's actually doing pretty well on Spotify. Anyway, I cleaned him up with AI and gave him two new gay lovers: George and Jorge."

"Wait, you generated fake AI lovers for your meth-head uncle and put them in your family photo?"

"Uh huh."

"It's bizarre, but you can never have enough JoJos. What's with the new kid up front?"

"Oh, that's Dewey. He's AI too."

"Decided to round out the nephews, huh?"

"Yeah, my Aunt Jolene chased her dog Dolly out onto an 8-lane highway and got hit by a Waymo."

"Holy shit."

"The nation's first AI-operated vehicular fatality. Fortunately, my nephews stayed on the sidewalk. Unfortunately—"

"Oh my God. They were there? They saw it happen?

"They did."

"Jesus"

"It's alright. Grandma Jolyne says it was a mercy when the semi-driver behind the Waymo jerked his wheel to dodge Jolene's crumpled corpse, ramped up onto the curb, and flattened those innocent angels like cherubic pancakes."

"..."

"Grandma always did have a way with words."

"Dude."

"She died of heartache shortly after. And Grandpa Jonathan ate his shotgun the very next week. And then my cousin Johnny—"

"Fucking hell, man. You're really  putting my Dad's cancer in perspective right now."

"Anyway, it felt wrong not having them all in the picture, you know? And Jolene always wanted one more kid."

"And, uh, all these other people in the back?"

"Oh. Those are just random AI generations."

"..."

"Some other stuff went down and there are so few of us left now, the family photo felt was feeling kinda...sparse."

"Well, this has gone from mildly cringe to utterly bleak. But I'm sorry, man. Really."

"It's okay. I think that's why I keep going back to last year's photo. Like, it's nice I can still include everyone with AI and all, but that was the last photo that was just us, you know?"

"Yeah."

"The last photo that was real."

"Yeah. Well, I mean, except it wasn't."

"Hm?"

"Never mind."
