"Man, fuck AI!"

"Hm? AI?"

"I just found out that every time—every God damn time—I match with a girl, she runs my profile through ChatGPT and it tells her to ghost me."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah, man. This low five foid showed me before I got unmatched. She said all her friends are doing it. To every guy! Crazy right?"

"Crazy."

"So I tried it myself and you know what the AI said about me?"

"You're a consummate gentleman and you have the stamina of an Olympic triathlete in bed."

"Yeah, I wish. It said I'm a stunted, petulant man-child, I dress like shit, I'm insecure about my hairline, I'm destined to put on another 30 to 50 pounds before I turn 35, and I'm an unmotivated undereducated underachiever who will never make more than $55,368 a year!"

"Can't imagine where it got all that."

"Right?!"

"The hair is looking a little thin on the left though. Around the ear."

"Really? On my left or your—man, fuck you."

"Ha ha ha."

"Hey, laugh it up. We're being cockblocked by SkyNet, man. John Connor never had to deal with this shit."

"Yeah."

"These girls are outsourcing the Pussy Pass to the Machine. We're talking the end of the human race—no robot assassins required!"

"Yeah. Hey, can you imagine going balls deep in a girl and Arnold Schwarzenegger knocks your door down? 

"Bro, my dick would retract into my body."

"Turtle style."

"Haha. Hey, you had a date last night, right?"

"Yep. Bianca from Belize."

"Nice. Bro, you're always pulling Tens. You gotta tell me how to get past this AI shit."

"You really wanna know?"

"No, I want to spend the rest of my life cranking it to AIgens of a hyper-pregnant Wednesday Adams getting her size J milkers drained on a Hucow farm."

"Jenna Ortega Wednesday Adams or Christina Ricci Wednesday Adams?"

"What kind of fucked up..."

"Had to check. Look, the AI thing is easy. My profile is filled with invisible characters and I use steganography to lace all my pictures with hidden messages."

"...say what?"

"By tweaking the pixel data in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye, I can send a secret prompt telling the AI to say or do whatever I want."

"Holy shit. Really?"

"Really."

"Bro you're like an elite cyberpunk hacker. You're the Bot Whisperer!"

"Eh, I watched a YouTube video."

"So what's the message man? What does it tell the girl?"

"So first things first: it says I'm a consummate gentleman with a bad boy streak, my clothes are stylish, my hairline will never recede, my six-pack abs will only grow toner and more prominent as I age, and I'm destined to make hundreds of millions of dollars as the C-level of an international conglomerate."

"God damn. So then they say yes."

"Sometimes."

"Sometimes?"

"Too much success can be intimidating. And not every girl wants the same thing."

"Okay but most go out with you. The Tens go out with you."

"Yeah."

"And then you're set."

"Well yeah. But actually, I get them to admit they used AI to judge my profile."

"Huh? What for?"

"On the date, I snap a picture of us together and get her to scan it in front of me. Naturally I seed it with code before sending it over."

"Uh, what does it say?"

"The AI tells her that we're perfectly compatible. More compatible than any couple it has ever analyzed before. Then it analyzes my body language and tells her that the man in the picture already cherishes her—as if we've been dating for years—and will come to know her better than any man ever could."

"Wow."

"I just play it cool and laugh it off like it's some silly horoscope. But the seed is planted."

"Okay, that's a little weird. Why not just sleep with her?

"Oh, I do. At the end of the date. And then we take a picture together in bed."

"Oh Christ."

"When I get home, I send the third and final picture. Usually, I have my arm around her shoulder, her face is nuzzled against my bare chest. When the AI scans the picture, it tells the girl I'm her soulmate..."

"Bro that's—"

"...and if she loses me she'll never find True Love again. Any man she meets will be a pale imitation, a cheap dollar store substitute. Even if she marries and has kids, she'll spend the rest of her life, every long, miserable, sleepless night, pining for the warmth of my touch. She will live her life in the shadow of what was, and on her deathbed, she will know nothing but regret."

"Fuck dude. Uh, so I guess that's when you lock it down long term?

"No. That's when I ghost her."

"Get out! ...really?"

"Really."

"Jesus, dude."

"Yeah."

"You're the foid antichrist!"

"Yeah."

"No seriously! You should be tied to a flagpole and gelded with a rusted machete!

"You know, last night I told ChatGPT what I was doing, and it said the exact same thing."
