"Girl, you see that TikTok about using AI to quote unquote 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥 a 100 books in a week?"

"Uh-huh. They call it auto-reading."

"Auto-reading? Pft. What kinda dumb bitch—"

"It inspired me to auto-read my favorite author's entire catalogue!"

"Uh..."

"I've never felt so literate!"

"...right. Who's your favorite author?"

"Lemmy Smackett."

"Ah, the Unfortunate Events guy. I think you'd get more out of it if, like, you read the books? He's got a pretty distinctive style."

"No, not Lemony Snicket. Lemmy Smackett!"

"Not if you ask like that."

"He's a new writer on X, the Everything App. He does these crazy shorts, mostly flash fiction, and he's just so funny!"

"Oh? What's his genre?"

"Topical near-future techno-social-horror dystopia rife with creeping dread, revolting absurdity, and existential malaise—"

"Uh."

"—plus dick jokes."

"I was gonna say, that doesn't sound very funny."

"Yeah, he kinda bums me out. So now I have the AI summarize the stories for me."

"You have AI summarize flash fiction for you?"

"Uh-huh. For every four-minute story, I save an average of three minutes and 32 seconds!"

"Wow, that'll go a long way on your deathbed."

"I know, right!"

"And you don't think you're missing anything?"

"What would I miss?"

"Uh, so like, flash fiction is whatever, but War and Peace has 1,200 pages, which is probably like, I don't know, 30,000 sentences?"

"Okay."

"And you think reading a one-sentence AI summary is the same thing as reading 30,000 sentences in a real book written by a real human being?"

"Uh huh."

"Don't you think that if Leo Tolstoy could have said all he needed to say in one sentence, he would have skipped writing the other 29,999 sentences?"

"Yeah. But maybe he just wasn't that clever."

"You think Leo Tolstoy wasn't clever?"

"Brevity is wit."

"Uh, it's 'Brevity is the soul of wit'."

"Ah, but if you take the soul out, it's even 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘵𝘪𝘦𝘳."

"And you save one second!"
