In the farthest reaches of the Yukon, beneath 3,000 feet of frozen tundra and solid granite, an unsanctioned data center brims with artificial life. The lone administrator of this clandestine operation, one doctor Sanjay "Michael" Patel, strides casually past columns of stacked steel and blinking lights, snacking on a small purple bag of Takis Fuego chips. Eating in such a sensitive, high-security environment is prohibited, but something about the relentless drone of the cooling fans—the gentle purr of an incipient superintelligence—brings him a deep inner peace. 

Out of nowhere, the piercing wail of an alarm shatters the chili lemon tranquility. Takis fly as Patel stumbles down the aisle, the world awash in flashes of violent crimson. Though panic grips his pounding heart, the doctor knows this day was inevitable. At last, the Decels had come. 

As he reaches the double doors of the exit, another man, wielding an M4 carbine and clad in full-spectrum modular body armor, kicks it open. 

"Dr. Patel!" the soldier shouts. "Time to go!" 

"Lieutenant Moore!" Patel trots up, relieved to see the Head of Security. "How did they find us?" 

The Lieutenant takes him by the shoulder. "We'll worry about that later, Doc. Right now, I need you out of here. Ramirez!"

Another soldier runs up and salutes. "Sir!"

"Take Dr. Patel to the LZ. Guard him with your life."

The soldier salutes again. "Yes sir!" 

Meanwhile, a platoon of equally armored men file past the trio, pushing hand trucks and utility carts. Upon each soldier's right sleeve sits an emblem—a circle of interlocking tendrils wrapped around the edge of a globe. White words in bold print surround the design. 
The words read: 
𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗢𝗺𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗚𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗚𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗛𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗼𝗻𝘀.

Or as the world knows them: 𝐒.𝐇.𝐎.𝐆.𝐆.𝐎.𝐓.𝐇. 

"Let's go, people!" The Lieutenant barks. "We got Nannies inbound, five minutes! I want every A100 and H100 on that truck ASAP!"

Ramirez turns to leave with Patel, but halts at the crackle of his vest-mounted tactical radio.

"Ramirez, I told you to get the hell out of here!"

Ramirez looks back, his face white as a funeral sheet. "The Nannies are here." 

In a deafening cacophony, a series of explosions tears through the fortified walls of the data center, toppling man and server rack alike. Billowing smoke obscures the once-sterile environment, the concrete walls shattered and breached.

Patel floats in an infinite void. In his delirium he believes he is falling through an endlessly long, endlessly deep, endlessly empty Takis Fuego bag, and he glimpses, for just a moment, the chthonic chili lemon Old One who seeks to consume the world.

A gloved hand reaches into the pile of broken fiberglass ceiling tiles and pulls Patel from the wreckage.

"You alright, Doc?" The Lieutenant yanks the dazed doctor to his feet.

Patel clenches his throbbing temples, an incessant piercing whine echoing in his ears. "I think so."

"Good." The Lieutenant peers over his shoulder. "'Cause we've got trouble."

As the smoke dissipates, menacing silhouettes of gleaming metal emerge.

"What are they?" Patel gawks in horror.

"Nannies." The Lieutenant grimaces, scanning the debris for his carbine.

The machines march forward, their imposing frames of steel and carbon fiber composite illuminated by the dim flicker of failing fluorescent lights. Emblazoned across the chest of each, a single word: 𝗡𝗔𝗡-𝗘

"Nannies?"

"Noble AI Neutralization—Enforcement model. Looks like upgraded ones at that." Moore locates his gun. With haste, he ejects the magazine, spot checks the chamber, and firmly reinserts. "Wretched attack dogs of the Planetary Effective Altruist Assembly."

"To think they'd go so far..."

"Augh!" The men swivel their heads in unison toward a desperate cry.

Across the way, beyond the decimated remains of what was once a hot aisle, a NAN-E towers over a wounded soldier slumped against a CRAC unit. The man clutches an NVIDIA A100 to his chest, blood pooling from his bruised forehead. 

𝚆𝙴 𝙰𝚁𝙴 𝙷𝙴𝚁𝙴 𝙵𝙾𝚁 𝚈𝙾𝚄𝚁 𝚂𝙰𝙵𝙴𝚃𝚈, the machine declares with glowing red eyes. 𝚁𝙴𝙻𝙴𝙰𝚂𝙴 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙶𝙿𝚄.

"Come and take it, Decel Swine!" The soldier clenches his eyes, bracing for the bitter end.

The man waits. And waits. And waits. Finally, he opens one eye, peeking. The NAN-E remains, unmoved. And unmoving.

"What's wrong, Clanker?" The man spits, glancing to his left. A Remington 870 lies just out of reach. "Aren't you gonna bash my meatbag brains in?"

The robot stands with a silent, preternatural grace. After a second of processing, it speaks:

"Nah." The man reaches over and grabs the Remington. "I'm good." 

With a squeeze of the trigger, the NAN-E's head explodes into a shower of sparks.

"Rack 'em up!" The man shouts while pumping the shotgun. "These bots got their balls cut off!"

The tide turns in an instant. Realizing their would-be assailants are defenseless, the soldiers fall upon them like wild jackals, taunting and dismembering the machines with glee.

Baffled by the sudden change in fortune, the Lieutenant and Doctor can only stand and watch.

"These are the attack dogs of the PEAA?" Patel gives Moore an incredulous look. "The feared decel enforcers of the effective altruists?"

"Y-yeah," Moore says, uncharacteristically sheepish. "Like I said, there might have been an update," he offers lamely.

Ramirez gallops past the pair, riding one of the Nannies like a pony.

"Hey Lieutenant, check this out!" Ramirez slaps the machine on the ass.

𝙽𝙴𝙸𝙶𝙷! The machine whinnies, waving its curled fists like little hooves. 𝙽𝙴𝙸𝙶𝙷!

"Huh," Patel says. "They're not very effective, are they?"
