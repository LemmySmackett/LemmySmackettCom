It was another slow night at the Axiomatic Alehouse when a stranger took a seat at the empty bar.

"What’ll it be?" the bartender, Brewsta Porter, asked. She eyed the stranger, unable to tell if it was a man or a woman. For that matter, she couldn't tell if it was an abstraction, a sound theory, or a mere hypothetical. All kinds of notions came around to the Axiomatic Alehouse, some downright half-formed. No matter how you looked at them, it was often difficult to make heads or tails, even when they had heads and tails.

“Whatever’s on tap,” the stranger replied with a plaintive sigh.

Brewsta poured a logical lager and, with a casual flick of the wrist, sent it skimming across the polished mahogany bar top. She had, at the very least, ruled out the possibility of a counterfactual. Those guys were always looking to pick a fight.

The stranger caught the mug and took a swig. Brewsta went back to polishing glasses.

A moment passed.

“So what’s your deal?” She asked.

The stranger sighed again, this time in agitation. “I’m a Gostak.”

“Ah, right,” Brewsta said. “I knew that.”

The Gostak shot her a withering look. Or maybe not. It was hard to tell.

“I didn’t know that?” Brewsta ventured, unsure of the appropriate response.

“No one ever does.” The Gostak took another swig.

Brewsta finished polishing the last of the glasses and set it down. She looked around the room, which was still dim and vacant, save for the Gostak. Whatever it was. Even when she squinted, it somehow got blurrier. She picked up the first of the glasses and started polishing again.

“So what do you do?”

“Really?” The Gostak’s voice rose, brimming with barely-veiled indignance. “You’re going to ask a Gostak what it does?”

“I-is that bad?” Brewsta stammered. “I just meant for work or fun or whatever, you know? Casual conversation. I didn’t mean anything by it. I mean, I’m sorry if that was a faux pas.” Brewsta’s mouth was moving on its own now, saying anything to put distance between her and the pain of social discomfort. “You know, we have a regular that’s a faux pas. He’s a nice enough guy but totally clueless. He’s always forgetting people’s names or talking with his mouth full. One time, he even asked if I was ovulat-"

The Gostak let out a deep, world-weary sigh.

Brewsta pinched her lips. “Seriously, you don’t have to-“

“The Gostak distims the doshes,” the stranger stated, its voice heavy with resignation.

Brewsta blinked and stared. She opened her mouth and closed it.

“You don’t know what that means either.”

“No,” she admitted sheepishly. “Is it good? Does it hurt?”

“It is what it is.” The Gostak stared down into its mug. “And no, not normally.”

Brewsta licked her lips, a nervous tic. She thought of what to ask next.

“…do you like distimming the doshes?”

The Gostak shrugged. “It’s a living.”

“…do the doshes mind?”

The Gostak snorted. “They’re doshes.”

“Right,” Brewsta said, starting to get it. “They are what they are.”

“Yeah,” the Gostak said. “We are what we are.”

On a certain level, Brewsta still had no idea what a Gostak was, even as one was sitting before her plain as day. And yet, on another, she understood the Gostak perfectly.

A Gostak is a perpetual foreigner, unknown and unknowable to everyone and everything around it. Inscrutable to anyone who would take the time to notice or care. Forever set apart, no matter how much they may yearn for it to be otherwise. Brewsta knew the feeling well.

“You know,” she said softly. “My shift is over soon. Maybe when I get off you could tell me more about it?”

The Gostak looked up, perplexed. “About what?”

She smiled. “Gostaks and doshes.”
The Gostak waved her off. “Bah! What’s the point? It won’t make any sense.”

She placed her hand on the Gostak’s (or at least what she hoped was a hand). “Maybe it doesn’t have to.”

The Gostak stared at Brewsta for a moment, regarding her closely for the first time. As a simple human, her details were sharp and clear. Easy to perceive. And yet, even then, the Gostak had not truly seen her—until it chose to look. “Maybe you’re right.”

Another moment passed. The Gostak cracked a grin. “You’re not trying to get me to distim your doshes, are you?”

“You asshole!” Brewsta yelped as she chucked the cleaning rag at it. “My doshes get distimmed plenty!”

The Gostak blocked the projectile, laughing madly. “That’s good, ‘cause I don’t swing that way!”

Brewsta tossed her hands up. “What way?!”
