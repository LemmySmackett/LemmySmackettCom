The Skull King sits upon his Throne of Gore, fretting. "What if I'm not doing enough? I'm just here, day after day, sitting on my can. Does it even matter? Do people even care?"

His trusted assistant, the bog-goblin Stankrod, glances up from his ledger. "My Lord, from sea to bloody sea, all in this misbegotten land know that you and you alone bring forth the unceasing tide of death and mayhem that rules their short, miserable lives."

"Do they?" The Skull King slumps. "I should be out there, leading my legions, taking heads. How can I be the Skull King if I'm not taking heads?"

"Sire, your infernal generals are struggling to meet quota as-is. And we already have more heads than we know what to do with. Which reminds me." Stankrod checks the ledger. "We have a new shipment. Where would you like it?"

The Skull King turns away. "Oh, put it wherever."

"You heard the man!"

A towering flesh-golem hauls a large, creaking cart into the throne room and dumps its gruesome contents in the corner.

A skull goes rolling by. "What if I branched out a bit?" The Skull King muses.

"Branched out, Sire?"

The Skull King holds out a hand, seized by inspiration. "The Femur Lord."

"Femurs, Sire?"

"It's something different. Unexpected." The Skull King gives his assistant an eager look. "What do you think?"

"I think we have ten more shipments rotting on the Bone Docks and nowhere to store them. Please try to stay focused, Sire."
