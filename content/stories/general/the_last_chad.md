The spindly, broccoli-haired tribesman approached, hunching as he knuckle-walked. The Apple Vision Pro obscured his eyes, but they were certain to be sunken and listlessâ€”common for his people in their sordid, degraded condition.

Sheepishly, he prodded my dummy thicc companion. "Smash? Smash?"

She shrank back. "What is he...?"

I held out my arm. "I'll handle this." I turned to the withered brute and stuck out my rippling pecks. I had benched 295 just that morning. "No smash. Stacy. Wifed up."

The native hopped back and hissed. "Simp!" He paced back and forth, furious in his impotence. "Simp!"

I chuckled.

"My God." She muttered, clutching my muscled bicep. "They're so hideous. And pathetic."

"He's just one of the workers, dear. An expendable, low-class male in the eusocial hierarchy. Most spend their days gooning to AI generated reels, destined to die without ever reproducing."

"Well thank God for that!"

"Simp!" The craven creature hissed again.

"No simp." I intoned. "Chad."

"Cap! Cap! Be so fr rn!" 

They were a petulant people. All bluster, no bite. I unhooked the bullwhip from my belt and cracked it across the jagged pavement.

"Aaaiii!" The native cowered.

"Chad is here." I cracked the whip again. "Go and tell your E-girl Brood-Queen." 

"Chad! Chad! Ong! Ong!" he yelped, skittering into the nearest alleyway.

My Companion shuddered. "It's hard to imagine they were once human." 

"Then don't," I told her as we pressed on into the ruins of SoMa. "We're better off without them."
