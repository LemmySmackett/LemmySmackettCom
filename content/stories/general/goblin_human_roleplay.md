The goblin rolls his d6 dice. “At last, the adventure begins!”

“Why are you rolling?” The gnome DM gripes. “We haven’t started.”

“Just warmin’ up the girls.” The goblin beams, taking his dice back in hand. “Okay, so I’m a human paladin. And what he’s going to be?” He nods to the man across the table.

“A goblin rogue,” the human replies.

“Nice! Okay, can we start? My paladin is sitting in the tavern and your goblin walks in.”

The DM nods. “Sure. Go ahead.”

“Alright! Ahem,” the goblin puts on his best human voice. “Why you slime-sniffing, rotgut, grimeback, bog-jumping, muck-sucking scrag. I didn’t know they let greenskin scumstains like you in here.”

The pair stare at the goblin.

“…what?”

“Wow,” the human says. “𝑊𝑜𝑤.”

The gnome DM leans in. “You really want to bring that kind of energy into the game?”

“What energy?” The goblin puzzles. “That’s how humans talk to goblins.”

“Well,” the human quibbles. “Not all humans…”

“That’s how you talked to me when we first met!”

“Come on. I never called you a bog-jumper.”

“No, you said goblins are a bunch of feral, slobbering marauders who kidnap women and burn down villages in the dead of night.”

“Well, yeah, but that’s all true.”

The gnome nods. “Despite making up 8% of the population of Waterdeep, goblins are responsible for 67% of all sexual assaults.”

“Oh, okay. So I can’t say grimeback, but he gets to quote Sword Coast crime statistics at me,” the goblin fumes. “Nevermind that it was the City Guard who raided 𝑚𝑦 ancestral nest with a flame wizard and blew it to high hell!”

“To be fair,” the human counters. “You were keeping 30 elves in the breeding tunnels.”

“And 500 spawnlings!” The goblin shrieks.

“See, this is the energy I’m talking about,” the gnome sighs. “Now you’ve made it political.”

“Right, killing you both.” The goblin whips out his blowgun and shoots a toxic dart into each of their necks.

“𝑅𝑢𝑑𝑒.” The gnome slumps onto the table, unconscious.

“I knew it,” the human rasps as the world dims. “Fucking goblins!”
