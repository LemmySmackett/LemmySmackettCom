Linda! Linda! You gotta come see this!"

"For the last time Harold, I don't care how many updates she gets: I will not be in a polygynous relationship with you and Elon's discount Grimes AI babymama."

"Not that. Look!"

"He has enough flesh-bound babymamas as-is!"

"The Sarco euthanasia capsule does couples now! They're calling it the Double Dead Duo."

"The Sarco what? Oh for God's sake."

"You always said you'd get in the suicide pod with me if they ever made a couples version~"

"Uh, I did?"

"Yep, back when we lived in the apartment."

"Harold, that was years ago. Like a decade."

"Not quite. You promised you'd do a Death Cab for Cutie and Follow Me into the Dark exactly 8 years, 3 months, 21 days—"

"Harold."

"—and 7 hours ago." 

"You've been tracking that? This whole time?"

"Yep. I put it in my iCalendar the same day and my iPhone has reminded me on the hour, every hour, ever since."

"Honey."

"Most weeks it's the only way I make it through any one of these God-forsaken days."

"Sweetheart, that's not healthy."

"It's not, but we'll be dead soon so I don't have to worry about what's healthy anymore anyway. In fact, I don't have to worry about anything at all! Ha! Haha!"

"I can't believe they made this. Dual suicide pods? Really?"

"Come on, it'll be fun!"

"Fun?"

"You know, it's like strapping yourself into a little theme park ride—that kills you!"

"Yeah, uh, I don't know."

"Linda. Dear. You said you would."

"I know but—"

"You gave me your word. And you know what your father always said about your word."

Linda sighs. "A man is only as good as his word, even if that word is AI-generated."

"There you go. I'll book us for next week!"

"But Harold—"

"Is your Tuesday morning open or is that when you have pilates?"

"—I think you're missing something important here."

"What's that, dear?"

"Well, I'm a woman. So, according to my father, my word never mattered anyway."

"Ah, how quickly the tenets of feminist equality go out the window."

"Besides, what about our finances, huh? I mean, we're halfway done paying off the mortgage."

"Sure, but think of how much we won't have to pay by being dead. That's big savings, Linda."

"Okay, but the equity—"

"Besides, they're doing a BOGO deal right now to celebrate the release."

"A BOGO deal?"

"Yep. Buy one inert gas dispensed death and get the second one free."

"Why—"

"You can even get a volatile gas death if you pay a little more. And sign a waiver, of course."

"Why do I care about a BOGO deal if I'm going to be dead?"

"I don't know. Why do you care about the equity?"

"Harold, this is a lot. We still have to think about the kids." 

"Linda."

"We didn't have the kids back then."

"Are you trying to back out on me?"

"No, no, I'm not trying to back out on you, honey."

"It sure sounds like you're trying to back out on me."

"I'm just saying we can't abandon our duty as parents."

"Uh huh. Let me guess: you want to wait for a Sarco pod that does four people. The whole family."

"Jesus, Harold."

"Linda. This is your word on the line. And unlike your father, I'm a feminist."

"Honey."

"To the death."

"Fine, whatever, sure. I'd rather wait for the demonic European pod-cluster that annihilates our entire family. Nobody would be sick enough to build that anyway..."

"And that's where you're wrong!"

"..."

"Behold! The Sarco 4-pod Four on the Floor!"

"..."

"Anymore objections, dear?"

"I'm not letting you put our children in the pods, Harold."

"Ha! I knew it, I knew, I knew it!"

"You need help."

"And YOU never wanted to get euthanized in the first place! Did you, Linda?!"
