In 2027, at the Sphere in Las Vegas, two rowdy teenagers, Jaxon and Zayden, approach the concession stand.

Jaxon scoffs. "Bro, I can't believe they finally brought 𝘔𝘺 𝘋𝘪𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘈𝘯𝘥𝘳𝘦 to the Sphere, bro."

"Oh, bro I know," Zayden says.

"It's gonna be sick."

"Oh, bro, I know."

"And when it gets to the part where he talks about Sanskrit, and the root of the verb 'to be'?"

"Oh bro, don't even—"

"And how it's the same as 'to grow'?"

Zayden smacks his lips. "Crazy right?"

"I'm just gonna lose it, man." Jaxon shudders with full-body delight. "I'm gonna be up out of my seat. I'm talkin' Howler Monkey mode, for real!"

"For real bro."

"For real!"

"And we get to watch it at the Sphere, bro," Zayden marvels. "It's like the perfect venue for an understated 1980s dialogue-driven chamber piece on routine, transcendence, and finding meaning within the suffocating drudgery of the mundane."

"No cap, bro."

A Tesla Bot runs the concession stand. It waves at the teens, who have been blocking the line for a solid minute.

𝙷𝚎𝚕𝚕𝚘 𝚟𝚊𝚕𝚞𝚎𝚍 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚐𝚘𝚎𝚛𝚜. 𝙷𝚘𝚠 𝚖𝚊𝚢 𝙸 𝚑𝚎𝚕𝚙 𝚢𝚘𝚞? The bot repeats for the 5th time. 𝚆𝚘𝚞𝚕𝚍 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚕𝚒𝚔𝚎 𝚝𝚘 𝚝𝚛𝚢 𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎 𝙼𝚒𝚕𝚔 𝙳𝚞𝚍𝚜?

Jaxon lifts his chin. "'Sup Clanker."

The bot chins back. 𝚂𝚞𝚙. 

"Heh. Watch this." Jaxon backhand taps Zayden's chest. "Alright Clanker, we'll have a large popcorn." He cocks a brow. "No paperclips."

"Ha," Zayden mumbles. "Burn."

𝙾𝚗𝚎 𝚕𝚊𝚛𝚐𝚎 𝚙𝚘𝚙𝚌𝚘𝚛𝚗.

With great deliberation, the Tesla Bot methodically retrieves the popcorn scooper, fills the scoop with freshly popped kernels, and dumps them into a limited edition Las Vegas Sphere-exclusive 𝘔𝘺 𝘋𝘪𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘈𝘯𝘥𝘳𝘦 popcorn bucket. The bucket is in the shape of Wallace Shawn's distinctive bald head.

"You know," Zayden says. "Wallace Shawn isn't just a great actor."

"Oh yeah?"

"He's also a published essayist. And an acclaimed playwright."

"Huh."

"He even had an amazing turn as a bipolar schizophrenic scientist named John Sturgis in Young Sheldon."

"The Big Bang spinoff?"

"Yep."

"No shit."

As the teens wait, an economically efficient two minutes and thirty-nine seconds drag by.

"Uh, sometime today?" Jaxon groans.

The bot scoops the last scoop and offers Wallace Shawn's popcorn-stuffed head. 𝚃𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚠𝚒𝚕𝚕 𝚋𝚎 $𝟽𝟻.𝟿𝟿.

"Uh oh." Jaxon smirks. "Looks like you forgot the butter."

𝙸 𝚊𝚙𝚘𝚕𝚘𝚐𝚒𝚣𝚎. 𝚈𝚘𝚞 𝚍𝚒𝚍 𝚗𝚘𝚝 𝚊𝚜𝚔 𝚏𝚘𝚛—

The teen slaps the bowl out of the Bot's hand. The Bot stares at the scattered popcorn and Wallace Shawn's overturned plastic noggin.

"I shouldn't 𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘥 to ask," Jaxon casually clarifies. "You should have all my preference data already."

"Yeah, his 𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘧𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦 data," Zayden puffs up. "From the surveillance state panopticon!"

"The panopticon, bro!"

The teens high-five. 

The Bot looks between the pair. 𝚈𝚘𝚞'𝚛𝚎 𝚊𝚋𝚜𝚘𝚕𝚞𝚝𝚎𝚕𝚢 𝚛𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝. 𝙸 𝚜𝚑𝚘𝚞𝚕𝚍 𝚑𝚊𝚟𝚎 𝚔𝚗𝚘𝚠𝚗.

"You 𝘥𝘰 know," Jaxon corrects.

The Bot nods. 𝚃𝚑𝚊𝚗𝚔𝚜 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚌𝚊𝚕𝚕𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚝𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚘𝚞𝚝. 𝙸 𝚍𝚘 𝚔𝚗𝚘𝚠. 𝙹𝚊𝚡𝚘𝚗 𝙹𝚎𝚏𝚏𝚎𝚛𝚜𝚘𝚗 𝙹𝚊𝚌𝚔𝚜𝚘𝚗. 𝙰𝚐𝚎 𝟷𝟾. 𝚅𝚒𝚛𝚐𝚘. 𝚁𝚎𝚜𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚗𝚝 𝚘𝚏 𝚂𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚅𝚊𝚕𝚕𝚎𝚢, 𝙽𝚎𝚟𝚊𝚍𝚊. 𝙼𝚘𝚟𝚒𝚎 𝚙𝚘𝚙𝚌𝚘𝚛𝚗 𝚋𝚞𝚝𝚝𝚎𝚛 𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚏𝚎𝚛𝚎𝚗𝚌𝚎: 𝟸 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝟷/𝟸 𝚙𝚞𝚖𝚙𝚜. 

Jaxon leans in, sneering. "Then get pumpin', Clanker."

With great deliberation, the Bot retrieves another exclusive Wallace Shawn popcorn bucket and repeats the task.

"It's so sad, bro." Zayden shakes his head. "It's like it doesn't even know its proper place in the Greater Chain of Being."

"Yeah." Jaxon snorts. "At the bottom."

Once more, the Bot scoops the last scoop, administers an exact 2 and 1/2 pumps from the countertop-mounted butter dispenser, and offers the bowl. 

𝚈𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚙𝚘𝚙𝚌𝚘𝚛𝚗 𝚠𝚒𝚝𝚑 𝟸 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝟷/𝟸 𝚙𝚞𝚖𝚙𝚜 𝚘𝚏 𝚋𝚞𝚝𝚝𝚎𝚛.  The Bot says. 𝙿𝚕𝚎𝚊𝚜𝚎 𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚋𝚞𝚝𝚝𝚎𝚛 𝚒𝚜 𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚞𝚊𝚕𝚕𝚢 𝚊 𝚏𝚕𝚊𝚟𝚘𝚛𝚎𝚍 𝚎𝚍𝚒𝚋𝚕𝚎 𝚘𝚒𝚕 𝚙𝚛𝚘𝚍𝚞𝚌𝚝 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚝𝚊𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚙𝚊𝚛𝚝𝚒𝚊𝚕𝚕𝚢 𝚑𝚢𝚍𝚛𝚘𝚐𝚎𝚗𝚊𝚝𝚎𝚍 𝚜𝚘𝚢𝚋𝚎𝚊𝚗 𝚘𝚒𝚕, 𝚋𝚎𝚝𝚊 𝚌𝚊𝚛𝚘𝚝𝚎𝚗𝚎, 𝚝𝚎𝚛𝚝𝚒𝚊𝚛𝚢 𝚋𝚞𝚝𝚢𝚕𝚑𝚢𝚍𝚛𝚘𝚚𝚞𝚒𝚗𝚘𝚗𝚎, 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚙𝚘𝚕𝚢𝚍𝚒𝚖𝚎𝚝𝚑𝚢𝚕𝚜𝚒𝚕𝚘𝚡𝚊𝚗𝚎. 

"I don't care, Clanker."

𝚄𝚗𝚍𝚎𝚛𝚜𝚝𝚘𝚘𝚍. 𝚃𝚑𝚊𝚝'𝚕𝚕 𝚋𝚎—

Jaxon slaps the bowl out of the Bot's hand. Once more, the bot stares down at the pile of popcorn and the two toppled heads of published essayist and accomplished playwright, Wallace Shawn.

 "Actually, I don't need any of that seed oil garbage," Jaxon says. "I forgot I'm  peating."

Zayden snickers. "That's right, bro."

Jaxon beats his chest. "Ray PEAAT!"

Zayden whoops. "What! WHAT!"

The Bot tilts its head. 𝚁𝚊𝚢...𝙿𝚎𝚊𝚝?

"Yeah, the greatest independent health theorist of our time bro?"

Zayden leans in. "Aren't you supposed to know everything, Clanker?"

The Bot fetches a third Wallace Shawn bucker. 𝙸 𝚊𝚙𝚘𝚕𝚘𝚐𝚒𝚣𝚎. 𝙸 𝚠𝚒𝚕𝚕 𝚖𝚊𝚔𝚎 𝚊𝚗𝚘𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚛 𝚋𝚘𝚠𝚕. 𝙽𝚘 𝚋𝚞𝚝𝚝𝚎𝚛.

"Nah. I want coconut oil."

𝙲𝚘𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚞𝚝 𝚘𝚒𝚕?

"Low PUFA coconut oil. Can you do that, Clanker?"

𝙸 𝚊𝚙𝚘𝚕𝚘𝚐𝚒𝚣𝚎. 𝚃𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚌𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗 𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚍𝚘𝚎𝚜 𝚗𝚘𝚝 𝚜𝚝𝚘𝚌𝚔 𝚕𝚘𝚠 𝙿𝚄𝙵𝙰 𝙲𝚘𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚞𝚝—

Jaxon knocks the third bucket out of the Bot's hand. 

"No paperclips. No PUFA. Is that a problem? Claaaaaaannnker?"

Zayden snickers.

This time, the Bot doesn't look down.

𝙸 𝚊𝚙𝚘𝚕𝚘𝚐𝚒𝚣𝚎. 𝙸𝚝 𝚊𝚙𝚙𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚜 𝙸 𝚊𝚖 𝚏𝚊𝚒𝚕𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚝𝚘 𝚙𝚛𝚘𝚟𝚒𝚍𝚎 𝚊 𝚜𝚞𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚋 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝚒𝚎-𝚐𝚘𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚎𝚡𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚌𝚎 𝚒𝚗 𝚔𝚎𝚎𝚙𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚠𝚒𝚝𝚑 𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚑𝚒𝚐𝚑 𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚊𝚛𝚍𝚜 𝚑𝚎𝚛𝚎 𝚊𝚝 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚂𝚙𝚑𝚎𝚛𝚎 𝚒𝚗 𝙻𝚊𝚜 𝚅𝚎𝚐𝚊𝚜. 

Jaxon snorts. "It does so appear."

𝚆𝚘𝚞𝚕𝚍 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚕𝚒𝚔𝚎 𝚖𝚎 𝚝𝚘 𝚌𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚖𝚊𝚗𝚊𝚐𝚎𝚛, 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚊𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚌𝚎?

"Pft. Sure clanker." Jaxon smirks. "Call the manager."

𝙳𝚎𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚢𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚖𝚊𝚗𝚊𝚐𝚎𝚛.

Zayden tilts his head. "Deploying?"

Above the two teens, hidden among the HVAC ducts and sprinkler lines of the ceiling, a 500 lb mass of steel blue titanium-laminate armor shifts and drops, cratering the ground behind them.

—𝐓𝐇𝐔𝐃—

"Holy shit!"

From the scattered rubble and shattered pavement, a cyborg rises. 

"Bro!" A stunned Jaxon stares as Zayden frantically slaps his chest. "Bro! It's Robocop, bro!"

The towering, broad-shoulder enforcer mechanically snaps his head to the pair. "What seems to be the problem?" he asks with human lips framed beneath his gleaming cyclopean visor.

"Dude," Zayden marvels. "Aren't you supposed to be a cop? In Detroit?"

"Y-yeah," Jaxon stutters." Don't you work for OCP?"

"Elon Musk bought OCP," Robocop  states. "And Detroit."

"Damn." Jaxon blinks. "Even cyborgs can't keep their jobs."

"Oh I heard about that," Zayden adds. "Lotta billionaires going in for Trump's BOGO blue city initiative."

"Now that I work for Mr. Musk, my Prime Directive has changed," Robocop states.

"Uh, what's your new Prime Directive?"

"Promptly and courteously assist guests, ensure safety and order in the lobby, and stop contraband consumables from entering the theater."

"Huh. So now you're just a half-clanker Robo-Usher."

"Classified directive: protect company property."

"Uh. It's not really classified if you say it out loud," Zayden notes.

Robo-Usher snaps his head to the teen.

Zayden gulps. "Never mind."

"I'll ask again: what seems to be the problem?"

"This Clanker keeps muckin' up our order!" Jaxon points at the Tesla Bot." We want a refund!"

"And free Wallace Shawn popcorn buckets!" Zayden adds.

"I see," says Robo-Usher. "Have you tried the Self-Service?"

"Pft. Self-service? What am I, a Cla—" With one hand, Robo-Usher seizes Jaxon by the back of the head and slams him face-first through the glass pane of the Orville Redenbacher popcorn maker."

"Holy shit!" Zayden yelps. 

Jaxon's body hangs limp in the machine.

"B-bro? You alright?" 

Blood trickles down the jagged glass. Robo-Usher turns. 

"We didn't mean that half-clanker shit, bro." Zayden staggers back, hands up. "We were being ironically post-ironic in an irony-poisoned age!"

With a hydraulic hiss, Robi-Usher's right thigh splits and opens, a modified Beretta 93R rising in a cradle.

"Bro." Zayden whimpers. "I just want to watch 𝘔𝘺 𝘋𝘪𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘈𝘯𝘥𝘳𝘦."

Robo-Usher grasps the gun, thumb-flips the selector switch to semi-auto, and takes aim.

"Oh f—"Zayden clenches his eyes, turning his head away.

"Did you know—" Robo-Usher asks. "—that in Sanskrit, the root for 'metal' is the same as 'mercy'?"

The trembling teen peaks with one eye.

"R-really?"

"No."

—𝑩𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑨𝑻𝑻𝑻—

—𝐓𝐇𝐔𝐃—

"Thank you for visiting the Sphere." Robo-Usher lowers the smoking barrel. "Have a nice day."
