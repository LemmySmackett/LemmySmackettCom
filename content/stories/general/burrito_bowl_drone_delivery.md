Twenty-something Ron Griblick calls to his roommate. "Dude, come over here. I just ordered a beef barbacoa burrito bowl with extra guac."

Chester Fuddpucker looks up from his Switch 2. He's playing the smash hit visual novel DodecaDating: The Polygamous Polyhedronical Dating Sim. "Uh, gratz on the Klarna loan?"

"Just come here."

Chester ambles over to the back window. "Alright, what am I looking at—besides the crabgrass infestation our landlord won't shut up about?"

"A drone is going to deliver the burrito bowl 𝘪𝘯 𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬𝘺𝘢𝘳𝘥."

"Wow. Really?"

"Yeah, this whole city just got added to the national service area."

"That's crazy."

"I used to use it all the time back home. Oh!" Ron points. "There it is!"

Outside, a black dot hovers high in the clear blue sky.

Chester presses his forehead against the glass. "This is some Hideo Kojima shit, bro."

"Okay, so the drone stays up there, right?" Ron explains. "And it uses a zipline to lower the food in a plastic carrier."

The wire-suspended carrier descends, gently landing on a sun-bleached lawn chair.

"Wild," Chester says. "So now we just go out and get it?"

Ron shakes his head. "No. This first carrier is a decoy."

Chester blinks. "A decoy?

"It administers an electric shock that disables electronic systems—

"What the fuck?"

"—and can paralyze a human being for up to a minute."

Chester recoils. "Bro, it delivered a 𝘣𝘰𝘮𝘣 in our backyard?!"

"It's not a bomb," Ron says. "It's an anti-theft mechanism."

"Okay."

"You know how we have Porch Pirates for package delivery?"

"Yeah..."

"This is for Sky Pirates."

"Sky Pirates?"

"Yeah, so Russian cybercriminals operate drone cartels that snatch delivery orders and re-deliver them at discounted prices."

"Bro, you're throwing a lot of Tom Clancy at me right now."

"You heard me."

"You're saying Russians steal our food and make a buck selling it to someone else?"

"Yeah," Ron says. "Or you can buy it back yourself."

"They 𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘰𝘮 you for your own 𝘣𝘶𝘳𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘰𝘸𝘭?"

"Uh-huh. There's even an app." Ron flashes his phone. "See?"

Chester glances at the screen. "Wow, they really called it SkyPirate."

"Uh-huh."

"That's fucked up. Nice logo though." Chester tilts his head. "Wait, why do you have this installed?"

Ron ignores the question. "So anyway, delivery companies had to get clever and—Oh! There they are!"

A second black dot appears in the sky.

Chester peers up. "I'm not gonna lie, man, I'm having a real Ted K moment right now."

"Okay so the SkyPirate drone lowers its own zipline, snatches the carrier, aaaand—"

"Bro."

Ron grins. "Sick right?"

"Yeah." Chester laughs. "But it kinda sucks we got drone guts all over the yard now."

"No biggie." Ron shrugs. "The delivery company sends another drone to clean all that up."

"Nice."

Ron looks up. "And now the delivery drone delivers our food for real."

"Who knew burrito bowl orders could be so harrowing?"

The delivery drone lowers a second carrier onto the lawn chair.

"So what happens if there's more than one SkyPirate?"

"Well, for big orders you can pay for a multi-drone escort but that's usually not—"

An autonomous low-profile rapid-mobility quadruped dashes into the yard, snatches the second carrier, shits out a toy flag bearing the SkyPirate logo, and hops over a fence.

"..."

"Bro, did a robot dog just steal your beef barbacoa burrito b—"

"A ROBOT DOG JUST STOLE MY FUCKING BEEF BARBACOA BURRITO BOWL!"

Ron balls his fists, seething through clenched teeth.

"Well," Chester shrugs. "At least you can re-order it on SkyPirate."
