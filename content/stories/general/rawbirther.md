Mom, c'mon. I thought you'd be happy."

"I am happy, Simon."

"You don't sound happy."

"I just don't see why she has to carry the baby herself—"

"Mom."

"Like some kind of barnyard animal!"

"Mom please. We talked it over as a couple, and Nia and I agreed to have this child the old-fashioned way."

"Old-fashioned, ha. Listen, Cracker Barrel is old-fashioned, alright? This is just—"

"You know, the natural way."

"Oh, the natural way? Really? I guess you'll be dressing up as #tradlife Mennonites before you move out to the sticks—"

"Mom."

"—and then poor Nia can go into labor all by herself, without any medical supervision, and scream her little lungs to pieces while pushing a wailing watermelon through a hole the size of a tangerine—"

"Why is it always fruits?

"—and then promptly bleed out in a covered wagon."

"Sure Mom, vivid and thematically conflated as usual. Me and the other Amish brothers will stop at a Waffle House on the way to the Oregon Trail."

"Or maybe you won't need a wagon. Maybe you'll just settle for a pile of manure-slick hay in some dirty old barn?"

"Hey, if it was good enough for Jesus—"

"You leave the LORD out of this, Simon Kamina Jones!"

"You brought him up."

"You don't even go to church!"

"We're obviously gonna have the baby in a hospital, Mom."

"Well, that doesn't sound very natural to me."

"Look, I'm scared too, alright? But it's Nia's body and ultimately her decision."

"It's selfish is what it is."

"She just wants to do this birth thing the same way women have done it for thousands of years. Just once."

"See? She's just some silly little girl who wants to play-act like it's the 1700s because of all that damn rawbirther propaganda—"

"Rawbirther propaganda?"

"—and you're letting her risk her life and the life of that innocent unborn child for what? A TikTok video you could generate online in 3 seconds?"

"She's not risking her life for clout, mom. She's risking it to be a mother. Like you did."

"I didn't have a choice! And Nia can be a mother without risking anything at all!"

"Well, I mean, it must have been a choice on some level, or dad was more of a diddy ahh freak than you've let on."

"Your father was a saint and the greatest Gurren Lagann cosplayer who ever lived!"

"Inspiring."

"And it was ComicCon, alright? I always ovulate at ComicCon!"

"Really wishing I was born deaf right now."

"You joke, but what if that poor baby is born deaf, huh? Or with Down Syndrome or some other defect, God forbid."

"We're going to the ultrasound appointments and doing the prenatal screening like everybody else."

"Ah right, the all-natural, old-fashioned ultrasound appointments—"

[sigh] "I knew I shouldn't have told you anything."

"Like the pioneers had."

"Yeah, yeah."

"And who's gonna pay for it anyway, huh? Insurance hasn't covered these reckless rawbirths for years."

"I know, I know. We're...paying out of pocket."

"Out of pocket? On your UBI stipend?"

"I mean, we're taking out a Klarna loan too but—"

"Oh, that's good. Nothing like a little crushing debt to kick off the wondrous miracle of new life."

"Lord."

"I told you to keep him out of this! What's the APR?"

"...50 percent."

"50 percent!"

"Ish."

"Simon Kamina Jones."

"What?"

"This is a luxury neither of you can afford and you know it."

"I know, I mean, we could ease costs by joining a polycule but—"

"Oh don't start with that. You'll be a wire-headed eusocial drone before you know it. You should just do the right thing and get a perfectly good government-issued baby straight from the womb-fields of Super Wyoming."

"Uh huh."

"Don't 'Uh huh' me, young man. Those womb-fields have done wonders for the TFR. And equality! It's the Year of the Black Baby, and if you petition the State before the October cutoff, you could have a beautiful black baby to call your own."

[sigh] "We don't want a beautiful black baby to call our own, Mom. We want—"

[gasp] "I raised a racist."

"I'm not a racist! Nia's from the Islands! I eat fuckin oxtail every week."

"Then you should be perfectly happy with a fully black baby."

"Smaddy shot mi now."

"If you do it your way, you only get half a black baby."

"Mom. Listen to me. Listen."

"I'm listening, sweetheart."

"Nia and I—"

"I've been listening the whole time."

"Nia and I are gonna love our baby, whatever it is, however it comes out, no matter what happens, because it's our baby. Okay?"

"If you say so."

"I say so. And when the time comes, we'll get the next one from Super Wyoming, alright? We both know we're not made of money and every polycule I've interviewed with makes me want to eat a bolt gun."

"Well...that might work out for the best anyway."

"Hm?"

"Next year is the Year of the Chinese Baby!"

"Hurray."

"They're very good at math, you know."

"I've heard."

"And then you'll have a full 24 months after that to snag a Native American baby. If your Patriot score holds up, of course."

"Eh? The Native Americans get two years?"

"Yep."

"I thought everyone just got one."

"It's genetic reparations for all the land theft and genocide."

"Ah. Well, we'll see, Mom. The racial quotas thing is still a little weird to me."

"It's a new world. You know, some human representatives are pushing for a total ban on rawbirths. Because of all the loansharking."

"Yeah. For our benefit, I'm sure."

"—but they just can't convince the House Majority AI. Unfortunately."

"Saved by the machine again. Hallelujah."

"...you alright, son?"

"I'm fine."

"Well, anyway, I'm happy for you both."

"Thanks, Mom."

"And I know you'll be wonderful parents and you'll have a beautiful child, even if he is an unmodified genetically-disadvantaged rawbirth."

"Thanks, Mom. It means a lot to hear you say that. Really."

"Of course, what really matters is what grey market peptides you'll be injecting the little bundle of joy with once it turns into a toddler."

"Oh for God's sake."
