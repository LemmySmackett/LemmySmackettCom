"Dude, what are you watching?"

"Grunkadunk's doing the 7-week Casket Challenge."

"Grunkadunk?"

"Yeah, you know, Grunkadunk? The most famous streamer in the world?"

"What? The most famous streamer in the world is IShowSpeed."

"Pft, IShowSpeed."

"Yeah..."

"What are you, 90?"

"90? He toured the White House last month."

"Okay, Methuselah."

"Methuselah?"

"Hold on, let me pull up a stream by beloved modern leading man and star of the silver screen, Gary Cooper."

"Gary Cooper?"

"...you're doing the Solid Snake Challenge right now, aren't you?"

"Solid Snake Challenge?"

"Ssh, ssh, dude! Watch. Grunkadunk's about to hit 192 hours. 𝘌𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵. 𝘋𝘢𝘺𝘴."

"..."

"Oh, that's so sick. Chat is lit, man."

"..."

"I love it."

"So this is just some guy—"

"The most famous streamer in the world."

"This is the most famous streamer in the world, lying dead—"

"Uh huh."

"—in a casket."

"Yep."

"How—"

"Well, mostly dead."

"Mostly dead?"

"Yeah."

"How is he 𝘮𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘭𝘺 dead?"

"Well, so, initially people were doing the Casket Challenge by pounding back beta blockers to trigger bradycardia—"

"Uh."

"—but the problem with that is you can only go under for 1 or 2 hours 𝘢𝘵 𝘮𝘰𝘴𝘵 before you need to be injected with Glucagon. Otherwise, you die for real."

"You're telling me people were abusing drugs to slow their hearts and simulate a 𝘥𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘩 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘦 so they could lie around in 𝘤𝘰𝘧𝘧𝘪𝘯𝘴 for a 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘨𝘦?"

"Caskets. But yeah, pretty much."

"What the f—"

"And when the first version went viral, it didn't even mention the glucagon, so people were 𝘯𝘰𝘵 making."

"Jesus."

"The FAIL videos were grisly."

"That's awful. How did I not hear about this?"

"I mean, if the news reported on every challenge that killed teenagers in droves, they'd have no time to report on anything else."

"Fair."

"Anyway, the most recent version is way safer, since they don't use beta blockers anymore."

"Oh? What do they use?"

"Experimental research compounds illegally smuggled in from Shenzhen, China."

"Uh."

"See, they inject the research chemicals directly into the eye socket, and that simulates an effect similar to the beta blockers, but now it lasts for days and weeks."

"So it, like, somehow slows all your internal biological processes, so you can be fake dead longer?

"Uh huh."

"...that seems like it would cause brain damage."

"Oh no, yeah, bro. It 𝘵𝘰𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 causes brain damage."
