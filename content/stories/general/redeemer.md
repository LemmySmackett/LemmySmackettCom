On the news, they call us monsters. Before him, I was less.

Like many women in this city, I was once wasting away at dead-end jobs - with bad friends, beneath worse lovers.

How many people wasted my time?

How many men tainted my body with their useless sweat?

Daily my bones dried and shattered.

Like an old oak splintering from heart rot.

Or a forgotten doll collecting dust in some cobweb-ridden attic.

I was no use to anyone.

The sweaty men would leave, and I would get fired, and my so-called friends would text back, saying, "Sorry to hear it, but we can't come out tonight."

On and on, it went.

Somewhere it had all changed.

In school, I did well enough to get scholarships. I have trophies from track meet somewhere in storage. I won a spelling bee in sixth grade.

("Acedia" was the word.)

Life once had promise.

I moved to the city, from my small hometown, on an ascendant path - destined for certain glory.

That's what Dad said at least, before he died.

(He always had a flair for the dramatic.)

But then ten years passed and I found myself so miserable, so small, that if anyone had talked to me even once, for even a moment, they would've seen that I was the burst-wide carcass of a dog lying in some back alley.

Left for dead and yet, somehow, still breathing a shallow, desperate pant.

And then he saw me.

He lifted me up and cradled me, with all my brokenness, with all my intestines hanging loose.

He held me in his small, simple way and purified me, not with sweat, but tears.

God in heaven, he needed me.

And that's why the news calls us monsters.

That's why I stand here now, seeing the fear in my once-lover's eyes, hearing the words "This isn't you" as I watch the useless sweat streak down his bare, battered chest.

And he's right, isn't he?

This isn't me.

This isn't us.

The things I do now are horrible. Monstrous. Completely outside my character.

For the first time in my life, I am commiting real sin.

But this is better than what I was.

Better than being nothing at all.

With my face painted red, and the taste of iron on my lips, I take my ex-lover by the throat and look to the one who made me new.

And my savior works the magic I never knew existed.

Without words, he casts the spell that makes me draw the knife with ease.

He smiles at me.

I see myself in his warn eyes and learn anew the cherished secret that was kept from me all these tortured years.

I learn that I am human, because he loves me. Î©
