Off-duty Star Marshal Roy McQuaid stood outside Space-Trader Joe's and groaned.

"Really, Glykon? Again with the bug?"

A Man-Serpent in a chic Egyptian blue windbreaker approached, led by a giant red beetle on a leash. "I've told you before, Detective," Glykon hissed casually. "Her name is Sss'Sss'ThThThThTh. 

The Serpentian language is characterized by hisses of varying length, short pauses, and rapid tongue flutters. It does not lend itself easily to transliteration.

Roy sighed. "And I told you to stop calling me Dectecâ€”Jesus!"

The Gorgona Beetle, which was about the size of a small rhinoceros, skittered up and ran its hairy antennae across the Marshal's leg.

Roy hopped back, raising his boot in self-defense. "Keep that thing under control!"

Glykon lifted a hand. "Please Detective, she's entirely harmless. And merely curious. No different from your beloved canines."

The beetle chittered and clacked its mandibles.

Roy eyed the oversized insect as he lowered his foot. "Right. I guess you've never seen what a Terror Pit can do to a man. Or a regular Pit, for that matter."
 
"Terror Pit?" Glykon stared at the Marshal with unblinking eyes. He was a nice enough fella, for a Serpentian. But those black slits swimming in a sea of sickly yellow still unnerved Roy plenty.

"Seven foot tall genetically-enhanced monstrosities," the Marshal explained. "Space Cartels love 'em."

"Yes you humans do love to tamper with the Natural Cycles," Glykon mused. "Serpentians however recognize the sacred harmony of all life. For this reason, the Gorgona Beetle can be trusted among the most fragile of our species, even a hatchling. As long as it is not in the Calling Phase, of course."

Roy didn't really want to know, but the question had to be asked. "...what happens if it's in Calling Phase?" 

Glykon tilted his head. "They go on a rampage. Any school-serpent knows that a pheromone-afflicted Gorgona Beetle can kill and devour a nest of seven people in under ten minutes."

The beetle thrummed its wings.

"Uh huh." Roy's eyes flicked between Glykon and the beetle. "And how often does that happen?"

Glykon fluttered his tongue in amusement. "It's seasonal, Detective. You can set your watch by it." 

"Right, well, " Roy motioned for the Serpentian and his walking carnivorous time-bomb to follow. "You let me know when we're in season."
