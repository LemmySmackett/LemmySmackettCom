I pulled the yellow Mylar blanket tight around my shoulders, even though the shivers had mostly passed. The EMT was taking my vitals when a cop approached. An investigator, I guess.

"You were in the classroom, right?"

I nodded.

"Tell me what happened."

Normally I don't talk to cops. ACAB and all that. But today wasn't a normal day.
***
We were sitting in Mr. B's math class, talkin' about coin flips or some shit. Probability, he called it. He was trying to call on people, but only Britney would raise her hand. Classic Teacher's pet. Everybody else was cuttin' up. Blowin' him off. Usual day.

"Hey Mr. B!" Jones shouted. He was always the worst of us. "What's the probability you'll ligma nuts?"

Us boys cracked up. The girls rolled their eyes. But Mr. B, well, he got this weird look on his face. I never seen it before. God willing, I'll never see it again.

"Jones," he said in that flat Mr. Rogers drawl of his. "You don't want to see my dark side."

Everybody fell out. Laughing', hollerin'. We were still carrying on when he opened the top drawer, pulled out the revolver, and set it on his desk. 

It got quiet fast.

"Yo, Mr. B, is that a piece?"

"You know, Jones," Mr. B held up the gun, admiring it. "I never cared for that name." It was a snub-nose 38 special. Walnut grip.

The cop asked how I knew that. Call of Duty, I said.

"I'd prefer if you called me Mr. Bjornby." He swished the gun through the air, accenting his words. "Bee. Yorn. Bee. Can you do that for me?"

"Sure thing Mr. B—" Jones caught himself. "—jornby. Whatever you say, man. Sir." 

"Thank you, Jones." Mr. B took a bullet from the drawer, loaded a single chamber, spun the cylinder, and stuck it to his temple. "Now that's one bullet for six chambers. If I pull this trigger, what's the probability the gun goes off?"

The room was silent, save for a few girls sobbing in the back. One of the guys told them to shut up.

"Come on, people. One divided by six. It's not hard."

Britney threw up her hand "16.6 percent!" 

Mr. B sighed. "Thank you, Britney."

Britney was grinning ear to ear, I guess cause she finally got called on. I realized, for the first time, that she wasn't just a teacher's pet; she was a totally crazy bitch.

Mr. B pulled the trigger. 𝗖𝗟𝗜𝗖𝗞. We all flinched (save for Britney). Nothing happened. 

"Now then." Mr. B loaded two more bullets and spun the cylinder. "Three bullets. What's the probability? And Britney, give the other students a chance, okay?"

She nodded cheerfully.

"Hey, sir," Jones said, putting up his hand. "We get it okay? We didn't mean no disrespe—"

"Jones! You were the one asking, weren't you?" Mr. B approached. 

Jones shrank into his desk. "Sir—Man— Hey, come on, I was just play—"

"This isn't a game, Jones." Mr. B towered over him, scolding. "This is your education. Now if I make you put this gun to your head and pull the trigger, what's the probability?"

Jones broke into a sweat. "Fifty-Fifty," he squeaked.

"That's right. A coin toss." Mr. B lowered the gun, wrapped Jones' hand around the handle, and pressed it against his temple. "Let's hope, for your sake, it doesn't land on heads."
