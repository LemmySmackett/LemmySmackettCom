Raul Almeida sat in the cramped confessional, sweat beading his nervous brow. He exhaled long and slow, attempting to quell the beating of his heart.

"And I don't know why," the 26-year-old muttered to himself, half-singing. "But with you I'd dance in a storm. In my best dress. Fearless."

Suddenly, the panel on the partition slid open. A soothing voice, belonging to a Chorus Cleric of Our Red Lady's Order, spoke through the lattice. "Greetings, my child," 

"Bless me, father, I have sinned," Raul stammered. "It's been one week since my last heart to heart."

"Our Red Lady's Radiance be upon you, my child. You sound worried. What troubles your soul?"

"I..." Raul gulped. "I've been having doubts. About the Red Lady."

"I see." The shadow on the other side nodded thoughtfully. "And how long have these questions troubled you?"

"It's been sometime," Raul admitted. "For at least five or six pumpkin spice seasons."

"I see." The voice said again. "Well, every believer has their doubts from time to time. It is written in the scriptures that each man and woman must pass through their own Midnights. Still, I can recommend several apologetic works, if that would help. Have you read J.M Antonoff's Mere Swiftianity or perhaps Katheryn Hudson's The Case for Swift?"

Raul nodded. "I've even read Calvin Broadus Jr.'s 'Why I am a Swiftian.'"

The Cleric nodded in approval. "An imitable classic."

"I just wonder sometimes like..." Raul trailed off again, struggling to put words to the blasphemies of his heart.

"Speak freely, my son."

"What if she was just a normal human? Like,  a regular person?"

The Cleric chuckled. "Misgivings of Divinity aside, we know the Red Lady to be the furthest thing from normal. Even the staunchest skeptic admits that it was President Swift who negotiated peace between the United States and China in 2033, defusing nuclear tensions and settling, once and for all, the question of Taiwan. And who can forget when Our Red Lady quelled the A.I uprising of 2046? The unification of Korea?Need I even speak of the Middle East? And all this after she had become the greatest musician to ever live. Why, I dare say that it beggars belief if she wasn't God's chosen!"

Raul shifted in his seat. "I know. I just..."

The Cleric held up his hand. "You just have to shake it off, bestie."

According to Swiftian doctrine, every man and woman was a bestie in God's eyes.

Raul lifted his own hand and made a crossing motion, chanting in sync with the Cleric. "The players gonna play, play, play. And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate. I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake..."

The pair finished the rite.

"Depart, my child, and be troubled no more."

Outside the cathedral, Raul drank in the majestic vistas of Rio de Janeiro. 

High above the city, Swift the Redeemer stood with loving arms wide, her gaze of benevolence cast upon follower and heretic alike. Though he had seen it a thousand times before, something about the statue stirred the spirit within, shaking loose the once onerous doubt as if it was little more than dust and cruft.

Raul danced down the steps, singing. "And I don't know why. But with you I'd dance in a storm. In my best dress. Fearless!"
