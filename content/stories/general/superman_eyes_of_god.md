"Oh, Clark. How can you stand it?" Lois Lane flicks the YouTube app away and sets her phone aside.

Clark Kent looks up from his desk. "What's that, Lois?"

It's late at night at the Daily Planet, and as usual, they're the last ones left in the newsroom. Bright fluorescents hum overhead on the empty office floor. 

"All the pain in the world," she says.

"Hm?" Clark adjusts his glasses.

"The feeds are filled with misery. Video after video, scene after scene. Orphans clinging to the burnt rubble of their bombed-out homes, frightened soldiers chased to their deaths by mindless drones‚Äî"

"Lois."

"‚Äîprotestors beaten by riot squads in the street, politicians and activists assassinated in their homes, a woman knifed to death on a subway, people black-bagged and hauled off to God knows where‚Äî

"ùòìùò∞ùò™ùò¥."

"‚Äîand everyone everywhere feels the same encroaching dread. That some portal to hell has opened and we don't know how to close it. That we've wandered into a brutal wilderness and don't know the way back. That the gears of civilization are some great hideous machine‚Äîspinning, spinning, madly spinning‚Äîand when they finally snap, we'll all go with it!"

"Lois!"

"It's too much!"

"Yes," Clark says. "It's too much."

Her gaze falls. "How can you stand it?"

"We're reporters, Lois. It's our job to stand it. It's our job to see, so others can see."

She shakes her head. "I'm just a reporter, you're‚Äî"

Clark cuts her off with a glance. In the modern world, anyone could be listening. Everyone is listening. Just last week he started getting ads for bright red briefs on his phone.

"‚Äîalso just a reporter." Lois sighs. "I just wish Superman would do something."

"He tossed Gorilla Grodd into the Atlantic this morning," Clark says. "That wasn't something?"

"I wished he'd do more!"

"Lois."

"He could stop it all. You know he could!"

"Yes," Clark grimly says. "He could stop it all. He could use his powers to police the lives of each and every living person such that they never did evil again."

"Clark."

"That they never had the choice to do evil‚Äî"

"..."

"Or anything else."

Lois looks away.

"Lex‚Äî"

"Lex," she scoffs.

Clark nods. "Lex fears a day when Superman brings about a Perfect Peace. A day that would be the end of man as we know it. And he is right to fear it, Lois."

"Oh, he's just‚Äî"

"I fear it."

Lois stares off.

"..."

"...there's just so much of it."

"I know."

She turns to meet his gaze. "I don't know how Superman stands it. If he can hear it all, see it all, everywhere, all at once. How?"

"He can hear it and he can see it, but he doesn't always."

"So he chooses to turn away."

"Lois."

"I thought it was our job to stand it."

Clark sighs. He removes his glasses and sets them aside. "Did I ever tell you what Lex discovered about Krypton? About the nature of Superman's powers?"

"They come from our yellow sun." Lois shrugs. "Before it was destroyed, Kryptonians were remarkably similar to the people of Earth. Just normal humans like you and‚Äî"

"Me," Clark smiles.

Lois rolls her eyes. 

"That's also what I thought. What I believed. And for a time, it was true. Kryptonians were no different from Earthlings. But in the months leading up to the destruction of Krypton, they began to change."

"Change? How?"

"Their sun slowly shifted, from red to yellow."

"Red to yellow? I thought that couldn't happen," Lois says. "Stars only cool."

Clark nods. "A red dwarf burns at 3,000 Kelvin. A yellow sun like ours at 5,000. By any natural mechanism known to astrophysics, it's a complete impossibility."

Lois puzzles over this a moment. "...Brainiac?" she finally ventures. 

"Or some other interstellar entity of vast power. In truth, we don't know. The point is that when the sun shifted, Kryptonians gained powers just as Superman gained powers. But for whatever reason, theirs were limited."

"Limited?" Lois smirks. "What, they could only leap over a tall building in two bounds?"

Clark holds up his hand and extends his fingers. "Super-sight. Super-hearing."

"That's it?"

"That's it."

"Only two powers?"

"Only two. And do you know what happened?"

Lois shakes her head. 

"They went mad. They could see everything there was to see. They could hear everything there was to hear. No evil went unobserved. No pain went unnoticed. Instead, it was amplified. The pain of one man became the pain of all men. The pain of one child became the pain of all children. An endless scream of psychic torment consumed the world."

Lois covers her mouth. "Oh my God."

"And because no one could ever look away, there was no place for joy. Because the cries of others could never be blocked out, there was no time for gentle pleasures and small reprieves. The business of suffering became the business of the world. The Kryptonians realized they'd been cursed."

"Cursed?"

"The priests declared that they had been given the Eyes of God, but they had not been given the Power of God. Even greater than the pain, the unremitting agony, was their sublime awareness of their own impotence‚Äîtheir inability to stop it."

"..."

"Do you know what happened when they couldn't take it anymore?"

Lois shakes her head.

"Krypton burned."

Lois sits back in her chair. "Jesus Clark."

The mild-mannered reporter puts his glasses back on. 

"How did Lex learn all that?"

"The same way he learns everything," Clark shrugs. "Through bribes and false promises."

"Huh?"

"He got it out of Zod before betraying him to the Phantom Zone."

"Ah."

Clark checks his phone. "And now I have another ad for bright red briefs. And matching boots"

Lois grins. "Hey, chin up Mr. Eyes of God. At least someone's looking out for you too."

"Ugh."
