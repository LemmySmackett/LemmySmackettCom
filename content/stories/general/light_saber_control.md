Surrounded by the last remnants of the Resistance, a weary Poe Dameron takes a deep breath. "Somehow," he sighs. "Palpatine returned..."

Everyone gasps in shock.

"...and he's campaigning for sensible light saber control."

Heads nod as murmurs of approval pass through the crowd.

"About time someone did."

"Honestly, I've never felt safe around those things."

"My cousin lost an arm to a saber-wielding derelict on Tatooine!" 

The murmurs rise to a dull clamor.

"Wait a minute. Hold on." Hyper-Capable Omni-Disciplinary Force-Savant and Universally Beloved Protagonist Rey Last-Name-Here steps forward. "Guys, let's not—"

A Sullustan Mechanic talks over her. "They say only a good guy with a saber can stop a bad guy with a saber, but we've seen Finn wield a saber plenty of times and he can't stop shit!"

The crowd harrumphs as one.

Off to the side, Former Fascist Janitor Finn No-Last-Name-Either slumps. "Hey."

"GUYS!" Rey claps her hands. "This is Palpatine we're talking about—you know, the devious schemer who usurped galactic democracy, installed an oppressive totalitarian space regime, and committed mass genocide on a literal planetary scale? He's pure evil!"

 "Sure," the Sullustan shrugs. "But that doesn't mean he's 𝒘𝒓𝒐𝒏𝒈."

Rey blinks. "Excuse me?"

"Yeah." A Trandoshan CommTech cuts in. "He's advocating for 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 light saber control, not 𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑙 light saber control."

"That doesn't—"

"Even a broken chronometer is right twice a cycle!"

The crowd thrums in agreement.

"People, people!" Rey raises her voice. "He's a Sith Lord. 𝗧𝗛𝗘 Sith Lord! Even when he speaks the truth, everything he says is just another cunning ploy in service to his insidious machina—"

A Mon Calamari Seafood Chef points at the metal hilt on her hip. "Did you even pass a background check to buy that thing?"

"What?" Rey stammers. "No."

"Why not?" 

"Well for one, I didn't buy it." Rey lifts her chin. "The Force guided me to it."

"Yeah right,"the Mon Calamari quips. "I bet the Force guided it to fall off the back of a passing YT-2400 too."

Rey scowls. "I found it in a chest in the basement of Max Kanata's castle."

"Convenient."

Her pale cheeks flush hot with anger. "There wasn't even anybody who could—"

The Mon Calamari raises his own voice, addressing the crowd. "I just think any decent person would feel 100% comfortable submitting to a background check." He whips his tentacled head at her. "Unless they have something to 𝘩𝘪𝘥𝘦."

The crowd's gaze falls back on Rey, pinning her in place.

"Wha—guys! Come on!" Rey nervously lifts her hands, palms out. "I don't have anything to hide. You know me!"

The crowd's accusatory gaze holds—unblinking and unswayed.

"We've fought side-by-side as brothers and sisters in arms! You know—Poe! Hey, Poe! Help me out!"

At the crowd's edge, Poe stares at the ground, muttering to himself. "I passed on 𝘌𝘹 𝘔𝘢𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘢 2: 𝘙𝘪𝘴𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘙𝘰𝘣𝘰 𝘚𝘪𝘮𝘱 𝘚𝘭𝘢𝘺𝘦𝘳 for this..."

Finn stands beside him, also muttering to himself. "...disrespecting me. Making me little on the Asian posters. I didn't sign up for this..."

"Look people," Rey addresses the crowd. "I was trained by a Jedi Master, alright? I'm completely qualified to—"

A Rodian Dishwasher pipes up: "I heard that if a Jedi drops a lightsaber, it slices straight down to the core of the world and causes the whole planet to blow up."

Nervous muttering spreads.

"Oh, that's preposterous," Rey groans. "And that's not even how it works. The emitter—"

"Hey," the Rodian says. "I don't know all the details like a Saber Nut would—"

"Saber Nut?" Rey blinks.

"I'm just saying that nobody needs a Kyber crystal that strong."

"Hear, hear!" A voice cries.

Before Rey can retort, a service droid helpfully chimes in: "You should blunt the tip."

She turns. "What?"

"On the lightsaber," the droid says. "You should blunt the tip for safety."

"I am NOT wielding a blunt-tip light saber."

"My calculations predict that blunting the tip would reduce the chance of stabbing by 97.8%."

The crowd murmurs in approval.

She stares at the droid. "...but I want to stab people."

The droid tilts its head in confusion. "Accidentally?"

"Intentionally!"

A voice from the back: "Well, I just don't know why you feel the need to Open Carry."

Rey closes her eyes and takes a deep, pained breath. 

"Wearing it out in the open like that has to be a hazard!" 

"Now you're just fucking with me."

"It makes me feel unsafe!"

"We're the last of the Resistance!" Her eyes shoot open. "The thirty-something blithering idiots standing here are all that's left of our forces! You should feel unsafe!"

The crowd rumbles in agitation, threatening to turn. 

Rey pales. "Uh, uh." She steps back and, by nervous reflex, her hand brushes the hilt.

"She's going for the saber!"

"We've got an Active Wielder!"

"Everybody down!"

The crowd drops to the floor, huddling in fear.

Surrounded by shivering humanoid lumps, Rey mutters, "Well it can't get any worse than this."

The force ghost of fallen Jedi Master Luke Skywalker appears beside her. "Hey, Rey."

"Luke!"

"Can you hook a player up with some green alien titty milk? My dealer ghosted me."

"Oh that's ironic because you're a—"

Luke stares at her.

"Sorry, uh, can you even drink green alien titty milk?"

"No," he says. "But I like to remember."

"..."

 "I like to open my mouth and let people pour it on my apparition."

"Right," Rey says uneasily. "Anyway Luke, tell everybody the truth!" She gestures to the still cowering crowd.

"The truth?" Luke tilts his head.

"That Palpatine's saber control policy is crazy. That there's nothing dangerous about lightsabers at all!" 

He shakes his head. "There's nothing more dangerous than lightsabers."

"What?"

"Rey, I never told you this but the reason I abandoned the Jedi Order and retreated to Ahch-To is because I fell in love."

"You...fell in love?"

Luke nods. "The Jedi of Old had a prohibition against falling in love. And if I had followed it, the greatest tragedy of my life would have never come to pass."

"What happened?"

"We got married. Had a son. One day, when he was a toddler, I left my light saber unattended and he..." Luke looks away. "...he found it."

"Oh no."

"We found him Darth Maul'd in the recreation room."

Rey covers her mouth.

"Cut clean through."

"Oh my God."

"My wife couldn't forgive herself. It happened while we were making love."

"Oh, Luke."

"I was showing her how I made the trench run on the Death Star."

"...what?"

"Sometimes I like to close my eyes and let the Force guide my meatsaber."

"Okay, I don't need to know that."

"Anyway she killed herself shortly after."

"Luke I am so sorry." She reaches out, then remembers he's a ghost.

The Jedi Master sighs, looking off into the distance. "I spent the rest of my life drinking green titty milk on the ass end of space, thinking: if only I had followed the old prohibitions. If only someone, anyone, had passed a law requiring Jedi to own a saber safe, this horrible tragedy would have never occurred."

Rey furrows her brow. "Luke, it's a terrible thing that happened but I'm not sure a saber safe is—"

"Well, I've heard enough!" The Sullustan pops up. "A danger to society, that's what you Jedi are! I don't know about you people but I'm done with the Resistance! I'm voting for Order! For Safety! I'm voting for Palpati—"

𝙆𝙕𝙕𝙕𝙏!

"Argh!" The Sullustan collapses to the floor, his forehead smoking from a single singed dot—a fresh plasma wound.

Rey staggers back. "Oh my God."

Finn strolls up and postures over the corpse, grabbing his crotch. "Who can't stop shit now, huh?" He raises his head, barking at the crowd. "Y'all gonna put some motherfuckin' respect on my motherfuckin' name! I'm Finn Fuckit, bitch!"

The crowd scrambles back as Finn whirls, weapon in hand.

"And you ain't shrinkin' my black ass on them Asian posters no more!"

Luke turns to a horrified Rey. "You know, all things considered, what we really need is 𝘣𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳 control."
