Chains clatter and rattle as the Condemned pleads in the pillory. "Mercy! Mercy!"

"Sorry lad." The Executioner twirls his black-iron axe. "I did Miss Mercé last week." He raises the blood-flecked blade high.

"No, no!" The Condemned clenches his eyes shut.

The blade arcs through the air and halts, three inches short. 

"Ha ha!"

The Condemned gasps with a sob.

"That was practice." The axe rises again. "This one's for real."

The Condemned's lips quiver in murmured prayer. "Christ, deliver me. Christ, deliver me. CHRIST, DELIVER ME!"

The blade arcs through the air and halts, one inch short. "Almost!"

"You're sick!" The Condemned jerks his shackles. "Torment me no longer, demon! If you would kill me, then kill me!"

"Ah, I'm just having a bit of fun, lad." The Executioner lowers the axe. "You've already been pardoned."

The Condemned blinks, a strand of snot dangling from his left nostril. "Really?"

-𝑆𝑊𝐼𝑆𝐻-

-𝗧𝗛𝗨𝗡𝗞-

The Condemned's severed head gazes out from a large wicker basket, eyes hollow and wide.

"Nope."

A spliced-in low-res GIF of Kai Cenat yelling "Bruh!" plays, followed by an even lower-res explosion.

The King pauses the TikTok and shoots the Executioner a look. They sit across from each other at an ornate desk.

"Honestly, one of my better collaborators," the Executioner wistfully opines. "Wish I could kill him again."
