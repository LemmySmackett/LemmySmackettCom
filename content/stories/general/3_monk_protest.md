Outside the towering main gates of the Imperial Grand Capital, three monks sit shoulder-to-shoulder in the stone-paved road, legs folded in the lotus position: Brother Tik, Brother Qang, and Brother Duck.

Staring ahead, they chant in unison. "There is no enemy; only suffering. There is no enemy; only suffering. There is no enemy; only suffering."

Brother Qang lifts his right hand. The chant stops. He reaches into his sash-belt and produces a corked jar. Brother Tik and Brother Duck produce jars from their belts as well. 

"May this suffering awaken compassion in all beings." Each monk uncorks
his jar. An acrid pine-scented stench wafts up and stings their nostrils. Turpentine.

"May this flame burn away fear," Brother Qang declares. "May this flame burn away hatred." He tilts the jar toward his chest, moments from pouring it out. "May this flame—"

Brother Tik coughs.

Brother Qang repeats himself. "May this flame—"

Brother Tik puts a fist to his mouth and clears his throat. 

"May—"

Brother Tik clears it louder.

With an air of supreme equanimity, Brother Qang turns his head. "Yes, Brother Tik?"

"So uh I know this is a bit inopportune," Brother Tik sheepishly mumbles. "But I may need to...skip...the self-immolation today."

Brother Qang silently stares at Brother Tik. Seconds pass. Then minutes. 

"...why?" Brother Qang finally asks. 

"Well uh, I was talking to my physician—"

"Your physician."

"Yes, and he said that turpentine really isn't good for the skin."

Brother Qang stares.

"And you know I've been going heavy on the hydrocortisone. Really struggling with eczema."

"It isn't good?" Brother Duck asks from the other side of Brother Qang.

"Quite bad actually," Brother Tik calls over.

"Really?" 

"Oh yes." Brother Tik leans forward to speak with Brother Duck. "The physician said it causes an intense caustic burn."

"Oh my."

"As if your flesh was being abraded with a thousand cold wet knives."

Brother Duck recoils. "That's awful."

"A chemical flaying, as it were." 

"Well," says Brother Duck. "That is a bit much." 

"It's also a neurotoxin," Brother Tik adds with watering eyes. "So us breathing this in right now is not great either." The monk caps his jar. 

"Ah, that explains all the dizziness. And the mind-rending headache that's coming on."

"Exactly."

"Right, well, enough of that." Brother Duck corks his jar. 

Brother Tik leans back, glancing at Brother Qang. "You may want to cork yours too."

Brother Qang takes a deep breath and exhales. "Brother Tik," he says.

"Yes, Brother Qang?"

"Why did we buy three jars of turpentine today?"

"Hm?"

"With our last alms?"

Brother Tik shrugs. "To light ourselves on fire in holy protest against the Imperials and their ongoing acts of oppression and injustice. Of course."

"Right." Brother Qang nods. "And if we're going to light ourselves on fire in holy protest, does it matter if the turpentine rends our flesh? Hm?"

"Ah." Brother Tik blinks. "I hadn't thought of that."

"Mhm."

"I'm being a bit silly, aren't I?"

"You are," says Brother Qang. "May we continue?"

"Certainly."

"May this flame—"

"But what if they changed their minds?" Brother Tik interjects. 

Brother Qang scowls. "Who?"

Brother Tik gestures to the gates. "The Imperials."

"Yes, that's the whole idea," Brother Qang huffs in annoyance. "We light ourselves on fire and enter into a deep meditative state—never screaming, never flailing, as fixed as a statue of the Buddha."

"Uh huh."

"And the horrific spectacle of our unyielding resolve inspires the world to change."

"I know all that," Brother Tik says. "But what if the world changes 𝘢𝘧𝘵𝘦𝘳 we pour the turpentine but 𝘣𝘦𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘦 we light ourselves on fire."

A vein protrudes along Brother Qang's forehead.

"Then we'd look rather stupid, wouldn't we?"

The vein starts to pulse.

"Just flailing around in chemically-induced agony, going 'Ah, ah, it's burning, it's burning.' All a bit silly if you ask me..."

"It is a little silly," Brother Duck agrees.

"We wouldn't flail around in chemically-induced agony!" Brother Qang snaps. "We'd light ourselves on fire anyway!" 

Brother Duck and Brother Tik tilt their heads. "We would?"

"Yes!"

"Why?

"TO CHANGE THE WORLD!

"Right, right," Brother Tik says. "And what I'm saying is, if the world has already changed, it doesn't make any sense—"

"IT HASN'T CHANGED!"

"Eh?"

"NOTHING's CHANGED!"  Brother Qang screams.

"Oh really?" Brother Tik crosses his arms. "How do you know?" 

"Yeah, how do you know?" Brother Duck earnestly asks.

Brother Qang pinches his lips, shuddering with agitation. "Because—"

"Data, that's what we need," Brother Tik declares, cutting him off. "Comprehensive polling data with a broad, representative sample size."

"Oh that's a good idea," Brother Duck nods. 

"We need to go to the people and ask if they've changed their minds." Brother Tik looks up. "You! Guard up on the wall."

High up on the ramparts, a laconic city guard picks his nose. "Eh?" He looks down.

"Have you changed?" Brother Tik shouts.

"Have I changed what?"

"Your mind!" 

"My mind?"

"Your opinions!"

"Not really," the guard muses aloud. "I've always been rather set in my ways. A creature of habit and routine, if you would. Why, I haven't even changed my skivvies in three months! Or bathed for that matter..."

"That's disgusting!" Brother Tik shouts.

"I beg your pardon?!" The guard rankles.

"You heard me!"

"Oh, so this is how you monk types win hearts and minds, huh? Block the road all day like vagrants while judging a man for his personal hygiene choices and undergarment rotation schedule?"

"Three months isn't a schedule!" Brother Tik shouts. "It's an abdication!"

"I'll have you know plenty of famous Snubstack writers go months without bathing!" The guard snaps back. "Light yourselves on fire and piss off!" He spits and flips the bird.

Brother Tik looks at his fellow monks and shrugs. "That's just an N of 1. It doesn't count."

Brother Qang sighs. "Brother Tik."

"Hm?"

"You never intended to self-immolate today. Did you?"

"Well..."

"Or any day."

Brother Duck leans over. "You weren't gonna self-immolate?"

"I mean, it's all a bit much isn't it?"

"It's supposed to be a bit much!" Brother Qang hisses. "It's proof of our resolve!"

"Okay but how do we know it even works?"

Brother Qang's forehead vein bulges, ready to pop.

"We won't even be around to confirm it worked," Brother Tik objects. "Someone should stay back and confirm it worked."

"That's a good idea," Brother Duck nods. 

"Fine!" Brother Qang snaps. "I'll self-immolate in holy protest and you two can stay alive to confirm the world has changed. Is everyone happy??"

Brother Tik nods. "Quite."

"No," says Brother Duck.

Brother Qang turns. "No?" he rasps in exasperated despair.

"Not really." Brother Duck frowns. "We were gonna do this together. As a team."

"Brother Duck."

"We do everything as a team."

"We're still a team," Brother Tik assures him. "You and I will confirm the world has changed, and Brother Qang will burn to his death. Everyone has a part to play."

"No." Brother Duck shakes his head. "I won't stand for it." The earnest monk stands up, takes ten steps toward the city, spins around, and sits down in the Lotus position, facing the other two. "I'm protesting."

Brother Tik and Brother Qang balk. "You're what?"

Brother Duck uncorks his jar and holds it aloft in his right hand. In his left, he sparks a match. "We all go together or nobody goes at all."

"Um." Brother Tik raises a finger. "Quick note: if you light that, there's a better than decent chance you go alone." 

"Not if you join me." Brother Duck locks eyes with Brother Tik. 

"No, no. Don't give me the Sincere Eyes of Heartfelt Pleading. You know I hate it when you give me the Sincere Eyes of Heartfelt Pleading."

Brother Duck gives him the Sincere Eyes of Heartfelt Pleading.

"Ugh. Fine!" Brother Tik throws his hands up. "If we have to—"

"No," says Brother Qang, still rooted in place. "I refuse."

Brother Tik spins. "You refuse? Why?"

"Because your heart isn't in it," says Brother Qang. "Everything must be done with a full heart—with full commitment. If you don't give your all, nothing will change."

"Brother Qang—"

"Nothing 𝘤𝘢𝘯 change."

"Unbelievable," Brother Tik scoffs. "You're the one who brought us out here!"

"Yes."

"This was your idea!"

"Yes. And I'm the one who will 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘷𝘦 you here, free to pursue any insipid idea that flits through your vacant skull." Brother Qang stands. "I'm leaving."

Brother Tik reaches after him. "Brother Qang, wai—"

—𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑠ℎ—

—𝐅𝐎𝐎𝐌—

The pair turn. They watch as the turpentine-fueled flames consume Brother Duck. He never screams. He never flails. He sits, as fixed as a statue of the Buddha, a blazing inferno of absolute resolve. 

Minutes pass.

"I can't believe he did it," Brother Tik finally mumbles. 

"Yeah," Brother Qang numbly agrees. 

"..."

"You know..."

"Hm?"

"...I must admit..."

"Hm."

"...it's a bit much."

"Right!"

"We were all gonna do that," Brother Qang mumbles.

"So crazy!"

"I was gonna make us do that."

"You were! You were so committed!"

"I was," Brother Qang nods. "I think it was ego."

"It's the source of all suffering, right?"

"Uh huh."

"All dukkha, baby."

"All dukkha," Brother Qang nods.

"Hey," Brother Tik wraps his arm around Brother Qang's shoulder. "Forget about it, huh? Whaddayasay we go back to the temple, get some meditation in, and sweep the courtyard?"

"Well," Brother Qang says, allowing himself to be led away. "You know I love sweeping."

As the pair walk off, friendship freshly mended, Brother Duck's burning body remains in the street.

The guard on the rampart looks down and shakes his head. "Assholes."

As the scent of pine and burning flesh wafts up, his nostrils reflexively flare, catching a whiff of something else. 

"Eugh." The guard sniffs his pits and recoils. "Woof. I gotta take a bath."
