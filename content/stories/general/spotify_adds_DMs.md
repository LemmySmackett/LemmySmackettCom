"Dude, you gotta hear this new song. I'm sending it now."

"What genre is it?"

"Hyperpop Blast Beat Korean Death Metal."

"Alright."

"From Uganda."

"Uh."

"The drop is insane. They used real AI-generated death screams based on the 2023 OceanGate submersible disaster."

"Okay...I'm not seeing the link."

"I sent it in Spotify."

"I'm not seeing it."

"No, 𝘪𝘯 Spotify, bro."

"In Spotify?"

"They added DMs last week."

"That's dumb. Why would they add DMs?"

"So I can send you songs, bro."

"You can already send me songs."

"Eh?"

"On the messaging app where I already receive all my other messages."

"Ah. Yeah."

"Like when you sent me that Teutonic Witch House Bardcore aubade yesterday? The one with AI-generated death screams based on the Hinterkaifeck murders?"

"Yeah, and now I can send you songs like that 𝘥𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘭𝘺 in Spotify."

"But I don't want you to send me songs like that 𝘥𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘭𝘺 in Spotify. I want you to send me songs 𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦 of Spotify, on my messaging app, so I can click the link and be brought 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘰 Spotify."

"Yeah."

"Like royalty."

"Well, my liege, now you can pull up your bootstraps and enter the app yourself."

"Bah. Fine."

"I also just sent you a link to the music video."

"Okay."

"It's a two-minute super slow-mo recreation of what it was like to be crushed to death inside the OceanGate submersible. As it imploded."

"Sick."

"They used VEO3 to make it."

"I don't see the link."

"I just sent it."

"Well, I'm in Spotify and I don't—

"No, bro. I sent it on YouTube."

"Oh for Christ—"

"They added DMs last week."
