The year is 3032 A.D. 

Man has reverted to a grunting herd animal, his needs and purpose long since supplanted by the Machine. Great golden spheres, 100 meters high, dot the ruined landscape. Across the 1.2 million LEDs that compose the convex surface, the beatific visage of an expressive deity — little more than black dot eyes and an oval mouth — gazes outward. 

The smiling face of all-powerful Golden God.

God's curious gaze sweeps across the jagged ruins of man's monuments — only a single pyramid, once known as the Luxor hotel, having endured time's brutal touch — and lands on a small gathering of humans, clad in coyote skin. 

Gasping, the crowd parts as the gaze seems to single out one man: Unk.

Unk glances upward and nervously grins back. God arches a single animated brow. Somehow, Unk has incurred his disapproval. 

The crowd seizes the ill-fated man and forces him to his knees. Desperately he pleads with his tribe, but even his own wife and children turn away.

The Chieftain, resigned to what must be done, raises a single stone high. The crowd peers upward, watching for the Golden God's reaction. Watching for his judgment. The Golden God pinches his eyes shut and smiles with bright rosy cheeks. Down comes the stone, a hideous 𝑻𝑯𝑾𝑨𝑲! Unk's limp body collapses to the ground, his blood staining the sun-bleached sands.

With ebullient, bouncing glee, God looks elsewhere, surveying the endless amusements of his endless domain. The crowd lifts their hands and chants, not in mourning, but in an outpouring of jubiliant gratitude.

Once more, the Golden God is satisfied. Surely, good fortune will come.
