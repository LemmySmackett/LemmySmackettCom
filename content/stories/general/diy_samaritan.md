Adam Crane woke up screaming with someone else's mouth. 

In a mad panic, he rolled off the cold metal table and fell shoulder-first to the floor below. Grunting, he put his trembling hands flat against the grimy vinyl tiles and discovered, to his mounting horror, that they too were not his own. His left was several shades too dark and his right now bore the slender fingers of a woman, with cherry-pink nail polish to match. 

Distressing as all this was, the realization that he had neither feet nor legs proved the greater terror.

Up a nearby flight of stairs, the door to the basement swung open. Light poured across the rickety wooden steps as a shadow loomed in the frame.

"What's all the noise?" The shadow asked in a thin, lilting voice.

"H-help me," Adam whimpered. "Something's happened. Something—"

"I'll say." The shadow chimed. "You had that nasty accident."

The shadow descended the steps, carrying a large plastic bin. 

"Accident?" Adam repeated. It all came rushing back. "I-I was driving! That semi!"

"Oh, it was horrific. News says it's the worst 20-car pile-up we've ever seen." The shadow stepped off the stairs, walked over to a Harbor Freight workbench, and set the bin down. "Some foreigner, no doubt."

"Uh."

"They don't even have to list their names on the CDL licenses," she indignantly huffed.

"Okay."

Under the dim flickering light, it was clear the shadow was just a stout old woman. "My Harold had to pull you from the wreckage," she sighed. "Ever the Samaritan."

Adam lit up. "You saved me! Oh, thank God. Please call 911, I—"

"Now, now. There's no point in getting the government involved."

"Huh?"

"You can't trust anyone these days." The old woman retrieved a long, curved upholstery needle from the bench. "Least of all them."

"B-but my body. My legs!"

"Patience, sweetheart! I'm working as fast as I can."

Adam paled. "You're what?"

"Nowadays you gotta be self-sufficient," she beamed. "That's why God gave us AI."

Adam noticed, for the first time, the limp sallow olive foot hanging out of the plastic bin. 

"What are you—"

"Hold on, dear." The old woman held up her index finger with one hand and her iPhone in the other. "Okay ChatGPT, I've got the parts. What's next?"
