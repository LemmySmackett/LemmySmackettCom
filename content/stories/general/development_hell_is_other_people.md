On a famous studio lot in Hollywood California, a lacquered-hair, flint-eyed Executive enters a packed meeting room and snaps his fingers. "Okay people. I need reboots and big-name directors. You know the criteria—I'm  looking for the worst of the worst. Pure dogshit pitches. Go."

"Quentin Tarantino's Pride and Prejudice!"

"Wes Anderson's Robocop!"

"uh, Michael Bay's A Quiet Place?"

The studio executive holds up a hand. "Too obvious, Jenkins, keep up. Bill, Donna, you're doing great as usual. Round 2, hit me."

"Yorgos Lanthimos’ The Fast and the Furious!"

"Lars Von Trier's Forrest Gump!"

"Uh, Spike Lee's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone!"

"Passable, keep it going people." The Exec claps his hands. "Dig deep. I don't  need box office poison; I need box office carfentanyl."

"Guy Ritchie's Twelve Years a Slave!"

"Robert Egger's Legally Blonde!"

"Uh, uh, Wes Anderson's The Fast and the Furious?"

"Goddammit Jenkins!" The Exec storms up and slams his fist on the table." Is this a fucking game to you?"

"N-no sir!"

"Donna just did the Fast and the Furious!"

"I'm sorry sir!"

"I don't need you to be sorry, Jenkins. I need you to act like you know where your mouth and your asshole are. Can you do that for me?"

"Yes sir!"

"Good, because I need you to take your mouth and swap it out for your asshole—"

"Uh."

"—so you can open wide and give me nothing but pure shit. Can you do that, Jenkins?

"...what?"

"Cronenberg's nine headed cock, why do you always act like you don't know what the fuck we are doing in here?"

"Um...because I don't, sir."

The Executive squints. "Because you don't what?"

"I don't understand what we're doing in this meeting, sir." Jenkins gestures. "Or any of these meetings."

"My God Jenkins, Spielberg must have just stopped by, because I seem to have a fresh, steaming mountain of triceratops shit in my ears."

"Sir?"

"It's a reference to the first Jurassic Park, and do you know who would be perfect to helm the reboot?"

"Er, J.J. Abrams?"

"Harmony Korine."

"Sir, with all due respect, nobody wants to watch a dinosaur adventure movie by the guy who did Trash Humpers and Baby Invasion. Well, nobody sane..."

"Uwe Boll's Heavily Subsidized German Balls, Jenkins—don't you get it? We spend hundreds of millions to acquire surefire IP, court A-list talent, and lock in prestige directors—just so we can make enough boneheaded decisions to completely fuck up a final product so thoroughly, so deliberately, that the next poor bastard who tries to reboot the damn thing will need a Geiger counter and a hazmat suit."

"But sir..."

"Listen Jenkins: my job—no, my God-given mission—is to take every David Lynch on this planet and strong arm him into doing a Paul Blart: Mall Cop."

"But we'll lose money!"

"Of course we'll lose money, Jenkins! That's the whole point!"

"How can that be—"

"Now you've got three seconds to give me the dumbest idea I've ever heard or God as my witness, I will stick you like a pig, flay your flesh, and wear you as a Buffalo Bill poodleskirt the next time I go chasing femboy virgins with Kevin Spacey through the Bohemian Grove."

"S-sir?"

"Three."

"Uh, uh, Eli Roth's The Secret Garden!"

"Two."

"Zack Snyder’s Amélie!"

"One."

"TAIKA WAIKIKI'S JUDGE DREDD." 

The Exec stares down at Jenkins."...Taika Waikiki's Judge Dredd."

Jenkins clenches his eyes. The Exec snorts.

"Please don't skinsuit me, sir." 

"Jenkins." The Exec lays a hand on his shoulder. "That's the dumbest damn thing I've ever heard."

Jenkins peeks with one eye. "I-it is?"

"Only a total imbecile would come up with an idea like that." The Exec chuckles. "By God, you must be some kind of shit pitch savant."

Jenkins opens the other eye. "I-I am?" He looks up. "So I did good?"

"Jenkins my boy, you did better than good." The Exec squeezes his shoulder, beaming with manic glee. "We're going to lose 𝘮𝘪𝘭𝘭𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴."
