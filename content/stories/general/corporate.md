In every job in corporate America, I have been or will be obligated, to keep a certain set of knives.

These knives are made, not of metal, but thought and deed, sharpened on a whetstone of ossified compassion.

I carry them daily, alongside my laptop and cell.

In every job in corporate America, I have been or will be surrounded, by beautiful people, living to work.

They are intelligent, sincere, and eager to be of use. They wish only to belong.

I am told they are my family.

In every job in corporate America, I have been or will be asked, to plunge a knife into the back of my coworker's skull, in the crook where the atlas and occipital meet.

At best, I pretend this was pure accident. At worst, an unintended consequence.

It is a lie. They know it.

In every job in corporate America, I have been or will be tasked, with betraying my family.

We are told it can't be helped - that there is no pleasure in the fresh trickle of warm blood. That there is no taste to be savored.

It is a lie. I know it. Î©
