**KINSLAYER I**

A reckless youth once killed his brother. It wasn't his intention, but it happened all the same. Remorseful, he turned himself in and served his time. 

After twenty years the youth, now an anxious man, was released. He traveled from town to town, taking odd jobs under assumed names.

Whenever word of a local murder or some terrible violence caught wind, he fled, fearing the blame. He lived his days in dread, anticipating the time his misdeed would come to light.

At last, while working as a woodcutter in a small town, a passing traveler recognized the anxious man. The truth came out.

A mob arrived. The townspeople demanded answers from the murderous stranger in their midst, who lived under a false name.

"It's true," the man admitted, overcome by a strange elation that felt like freedom. "I killed my brother. But I never meant-"

The townspeople seized the man and hung him.

When later the sheriff arrived and interrogated the townspeople, they all said the same thing: 

"What do the innocent have to hide?"

**KINSLAYER**

A cunning youth once killed his brother. Though many believed it to be an accident, he intended it all the same. Remorseless, he turned himself in and bided his time.

After twenty years the youth, now an easygoing man, was released. He traveled from town to town, making a name for himself with his penitent tale.

Whenever word of a local murder or some terrible violence caught wind, he fled, evading the blame. He lived his days in pleasure, anticipating the time his misdeeds would come to light.

At last, while working as a woodcutter in a small town, a traveling investigator recognized the easygoing man.

The investigator demanded answers from the murderous stranger in his midst, who lived a false life.

"It's true," the man admitted, overcome by a strange elation that felt like freedom. "I killed my brother. And all the others. "

Before he could escape, the easygoing man seized the investigator and strangled him to death.

When later the sheriff arrived and interrogated the easygoing man, he claimed self-defense, saying: 

"What do the innocent have to hide?"
