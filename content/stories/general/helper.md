My love was lost in darkness  
and I provided a light.  
I set my arm aflame  
and it burned into the night.

I guided my love back  
and he made himself at home.  
He poured himself a Jack and Coke  
and sat upon his throne.

My arm sloughed off  
to ash and soot,  
and there I felt his rage.  
He savaged me for hours  
and I begged for days and days.

My love at last relented  
for I put his wrath at ease.  
I lit my face on fire  
when I got down on my knees.

By the soft glow, my love read  
The Proverbs of the Soul  
As long as he remained  
I gladly paid the toll.

My skin began to crinkle  
the light began to fade  
I don't know why he travels  
or ever why he stayed.

My love has long departed  
I didn't watch him go.  
My eyes were dying embers  
so many years ago. Î©
