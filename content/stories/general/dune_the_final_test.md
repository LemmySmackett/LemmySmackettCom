The Reverend Mother leveled the gom jabar at the calico's neck. "Now Son of Atreides, the final test." 

The kitten mewed. 

Paul blinked. "Oh. I thought the box wasâ€”there's more?"

"Yes." The Reverend Mother snapped. "You have proven your mettle. Your grit. Now you must demonstrate your character."

Paul glanced between the Reverend Mother and the kitten. It mewed again.

"Is this a test of speed or...?"

"You must merely Save the Cat. That is all."

Cautiously, Paul reached out for the imperiled animal, his attention locked on the old crone. With a predatory gaze, she watched as he scooped the cat up and cradled it in his arms.

The Reverend Mother lowered the High-Handed Enemy. "Very good."

"That's it?" Paul puzzled, petting the kitten. It lay on its back, batting at his fingers.

"Yes. I have seen all that must be seen." She closed her eyes. "You have what it takes to become Space Hitler."

"Uuuh, don't you mean Kwisatz Haderach?"

"You heard what I said, you little Twink."
