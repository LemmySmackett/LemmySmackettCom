"Aah!" She yelped, crumpling into her seat. "S-sorry. We're not supposed to yell on public transportation."

"Hey." I held up my hands, caught off-guard by the bizarre interaction. "All I'm saying is: in America, at least we can vote."

She slumped, a queer smile spreading across her blushing cheeks.

"What makes you think I didn't vote for this?"
