R**IZZEDNUTLOV3R HAS TIPPED $5**

"Five dollars? FIVE DOLLARS?!" The millionaire streamer Carlos "RizzDeezNuts" Fetz flips the bird at his 50,000 viewers. "Just piss in my eye, for real bro. What is that? Five dollarsâ€”it takes 90 dollars to fill the tank in my Aventador, bro. How broke are your bitches?"

The chat revolts::

>**BankaiBootyCall:** loser  
><strong>NoNutNaruto:</strong> what a ***   
>**JustSuperSayin:** ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€   

"Stay mad!" Carlos cackles, clapping his hands. "I don't even wipe my ass with five dollars bro. Abraham Lincoln will never MEET. THESE. CHEEKS."

The stream goes dark. The chat keeps rolling.

>**PAWGPunter:** stream end?"  
>**SailorMoonMe:** ?????  

Five minutes later, the video comes back. Carlos is tied to his gamer chair, gagged and bound. A figure cloaked in flowing black, wearing a cartoonish furry fox head, stands behind. The blade of a machete rests against the millionaire's neck.

>**Asstlevania:** chat is this real?! 

"Five dollars." A voice, distorted and modulated, drones on stream. "If anyone tips five dollars, he lives.'

Carlos' eyes, wild and wide, flick to his Twitch dashboard.

"You have thirty seconds."

For a moment, the chat halts. And then...

>**BankaiBootyCall:** nah, **** em  
>**PAWGPunter:** lmao ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥  
>**JustSuperSayin:** stupid stunt  
>**Asstlevania:** Can I have the Aventador?  

Frantic, the muffled millionaire jerks in the chair, stomping his feet. "Mmmf! Mmmff MMMFFF!!!"

The chat revels in the spectacle. Nobody tips. Not even a cent.

"Ten seconds."

Beads of sweat cascade down Carlos' temple. His blood runs cold.

"Five seconds."

The chat joins in.

>**LuffyHumps:** 5  
>**Asstlevania:** 4 :pogchamp:  
>**GarfieldGuzzler:** 3  
>**BankaiBootyCall:** 2 ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€  

**RIZZEDNUTLOV3R HAS TIPPED $4.99**

Carlos slumps in stunned disbelief as the fire emojis erupt. The blade slides across his neck, unfurling a curtain of velvet red. Î©
