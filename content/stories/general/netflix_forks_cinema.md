In a boardroom in Los Gatos, California, a brunette in a charcoal grey double-breasted skirt-suit rises from a Hermon Miller chair. "Okay, people, the bid for Warner Bros. went through." Her name is Gloria Slopmire, Chief Content Officer at Netflix. "How are we going to operationalize and vertically integrate these newly acquired IP portfolios across a synergistic distribution platform?"

The Chief Technology Officer, Algor Rithmus, lazily blinks. "Uuh."

"Whatâ€™s the roadmap for maximizing the asset flywheel?"

"Uuuuh."

Gloria stares at him. "Anything. Anything at all."

Algor smacks his lips. "We could throw AI at it."

"Fantastic!" she beams. "We embed AI capabilities, leverage machine learning, personalize content discovery, and accelerate scalable franchise development."

"...yeah. Sure."

"When can you have a demo ready to show?"

Algor scratches his cheek. "Uh, well the boys had the AI whip a little something up last night."

"Great."

"Actually, it offered to make it for us a whole month ago."

"Nice. Let's see it."

The 96" flatscreen TV on a nearby wall lights up.

"Okay, uh, so as you know, WB has a 100 years' worth of award-winning films, beloved by fans and critics alike."

Gloria nods. "There's a lot of juice to squeeze here, and by God, I can't wait to squeeze it."

"Uh huh."

"I'm talking both hands, vice grip, total drainage."

"Right, uh, so the films are great. We all love cinema."

Gloria nods. "We do."

"But even the best movie could be better."

"Customer obsession." Gloria claps. "That's what we're all about!"

"So we're launching a new feature that lets users fork the movie with AI at any point in the runtime."

"Like a Choose-Your-Own adventure book!" Gloria chirps.

"Right. Or like our own Bandersnatch."

"...Bandersnatch?"

"You know, Bandersnatch."

Gloria stares.

"The interactive Black Mirror episode we exclusively released back in 2018 and then inexplicably wiped from the platform?"

"I'm gonna be honest," Gloria says. "I don't keep track of half the shit we put out."

"Uh."

Gloria twirls her finger. "Keep the demo rolling."

"Right, okay, so uh...Take Cool Hand Luke from 1967."

A young Paul Newman, dressed in a chain gang prison uniform, appears on screen.

"The story of a stubborn ex-soldier who refuses to bow to a brutal prison system."

Gloria nods. "Oh, I love this movie. It's a thought-provoking meditation on authority, resistance, and the cost of individuality in a modern system that increasingly demands conformity."

"Sure, whatever. In this last scene, Luke escapes the prison camp for a third and final time, only to find himself trapped in a church. When he refuses to turn himself in, the prison guard, Boss Godfrey, shoots him in the neck."

Gloria frowns. "Oh, this part always broke my heart."

"With the power of AI, Luke can now dodge the fatal shot with bullet time."

On screen, Luke bends back, hanging under the bullet as it ripples past in slow motion.

"Like Neo in the Matrix!"

"Right. And then he beats all the prison guards up and flies away."

On screen, Luke hits Boss Godfrey with a shoryuken uppercut, shattering his iconic sunglasses.

"Fantastic!" Gloria claps. "A happy ending!"

"Yeah, the original was kind of a downer, and our data shows users hate downers."

Gloria nods. "We've got to follow the data."

"Speaking of downers, Bonnie and Clyde came out the same year."

On screen, Warren Beatty, clad in a rumpled three-piece suit and fedora, cradles a Tommy gun in one hand and Faye Dunaway in the other. Flashing a derringer of her own, she's in a slim knit sweater that blends French chic with dustbowl grit.

"Ah, the anti-establishment fable of two doomed, Great Depression era bank-robbing lovers." Gloria swoons. "I love this one too."

"The pair famously meet their brutal end when they're riddled in a hail of machine gun fire from an ambush laid by Texas lawman Frank Hamer and his posse of officers."

Gloria sighs. "A sobering, gut-wrenching conclusion to their thrilling spree of romantic violence."

"But with the power of AI, they can now bullet time dodge the machine gun fire, beat up the cops, and fly away."

On screen, Bonnie acrobatically flips through the hail of bullets, wraps her thighs around Frank Hamer's head, breaks his neck, and flip-flings his lifeless body into the nearby bushes.

"Brilliant! Oh, I always wanted them to live..."

"Lastly, we have Oliver Stone's JFK from 1991."

On screen, a stern-faced Kevin Costner in horn-rimmed glasses appears.

"Whoa." Gloria raises a hand. "Now hold on."

"Hm?"

"You're not going to have John F. Kennedy bullet time dodge the fatal shot from Oswald's bolt action rifle, are you?"

"Oh no." Algor shakes his head. "Of course not."

"Because that would be disrespectful. Right?"

"Yeah, no, I agree." the Chief Technology Officer nods. "And that's why we've put tight restrictions on what users can generate."

"Oh good."

"Both for the sake of meeting our ethical duty as a premier content provider platform..."

"Mhm."

"...and because it would open us up to an absolutely insane amount of liability."

"Right. Yes. Exactly what I'm thinking."

"Legal would go ape."

"Right, yeah, totally." Gloria nods. "Please continue."

"Okay, so instead of dodging the bullets, JFK catches the first one with his teeth, anime style."

"Oh."

"But the second bullet still blows his brains out."

"Ah."

"And then first lady Jackie O., in a fit of righteous grief, flies up to the sixth floor of the Texas School Board Depository, wraps her thighs around Oswald's head, breaks his neck, and flip-flings his lifeless body out the window."

"Granting her the revenge she so justly deserved!"

"Exactly." 

On screen, Harvey Lee Oswald's lifeless body plummets six stories and splatters on the pavement.

Gloria claps her hands. "Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. Oh, I don't think these IPs could be in better hands."

"Me either," Algor says.

"But, I'm curious, do you have any films in this demo that don't end with bullet time?"

"Uh, sure. So here we have a landmark in filmmaking, 1927's The Jazz Singer."

"Oh my."

"The first film to feature synchronized singing and speech."

Al Jolson appears on screen. In blackface.

"Oh shit." Gloria cringes. "We own this?"

"We own this."

"Can we unown it?"

"We don't need to! With the power of AI, we can remove all objectionable content."

In a sweeping fade, the blackface make-up disappears from Al Jolson's grinning face.

Gloria puts a hand on her heart. "Oh thank goodness."

"We can also get rid of the whole the plot involving a Jewish ghetto in the Lower East Side, since there's also some culture war prone, hot topic buttons there."

Gloria nods along. "Anything to limit liability."

"Right."

"Though I wonder..." Gloria puts a finger to her cheek in a fit of uncharacteristic contemplation. "If we remove all that, is it even the same film anymore?"

Algor shrugs. "Who cares?"
