Sarah was in line waiting for her order—a Venti ice caramel macchiato with three pumps pumpkin spice syrup, two pump vanilla, two shots espresso, 1/3 whole milk, 1/3 almond milk, 1/3 soy milk, carmel wall in the cup, extra whipped cream, all topped off with pumpkin spice sprinkle—when a gaunt man in a ragged, stained trenchcoat entered the cafe. His haunted eyes flitted about, a skittering rat after its next meal.

𝐺𝑜𝑑, 𝑤ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑎 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑟, she thought, folding her arms tight against her Jenni Kayne cashmere sweater.

𝑃𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑑𝑜𝑛'𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒. 
𝑃𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑑𝑜𝑛'𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒. 
𝑃𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑑𝑜𝑛'𝑡—

Their eyes met. His lit up.

"Fuck."

The man ambled over, clutching the lapel of his trenchcoat like a cartoon spy.

"Hey," he said.

Sarah pretended a nearby poster had caught her attention. It read: 
𝐇𝐀𝐏𝐏𝐘 𝐇𝐎𝐔𝐑! 
𝐒𝐄𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐃 𝐅𝐑𝐀𝐏𝐏 𝟓𝟎% 𝐎𝐅𝐅!

Who knew?

"Hey," the man said again, feigning a deeper voice.

𝐸𝑤 , she thought. 𝐴𝑛𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑤𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑒 𝑝𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑢𝑝 𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑡.

"What's your name, uh, girl?"

Was he serious?

"Linda," she lied, giving him all the cold shoulder she could shoulder.

The man blinked and stared. Everything about him was repellent. Deep scars cut through the patchy beard on his sunken cheeks; a mangy street dog in human form. They could bottle him in a spray—one spritz and no woman would approach within 50 feet.

The man turned away and lifted the coat to check something. He looked from her, to the hidden item, then back.

Her face flushed with embarrassment. 𝐺𝑜𝑑, 𝑑𝑜𝑛'𝑡 𝑑𝑜 𝑖𝑡 ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒. She'd already been flashed twice this week.

Mercifully, there was no flash. Not yet, at least. The man licked his hand and tried to smooth back his wild, untamed hair. He failed.

He cleared his throat. "Those are some nice boots."

She rolled her eyes. Of course, they were nice. They were $800 over-the-knee chestnut leather Stuart Weitzman's she copped half-off at Nordstrom.

"We don't have shoes like that where I'm from," he said, almost forlorn.

She sighed, resigning herself to the conversation. "And where would that be?" And more importantly, where the hell was her order?

"Um." The man licked his lips. "Upstate."

She shot him a withering look. "They don't have boots upstate?"

"Way upstate," he mumbled. "They really are nice."

"Thanks," she deadpanned. "Yours are great too."

The man glanced down at his bare, gnarled toes and frowned. He checked his coat again.

𝐺𝑜𝑑, 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑝 𝑖𝑡 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑎𝑙𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑦. At least then she could scream and be rid of him.

A barista popped up. "Hey, we're still working on your order, but someone left this drink. We thought you might like to have it."

"Why would I want-"

The barista thrust the cup into her hand. Sarah looked down. Something was written on the side in Sharpie. It read: 
𝗔𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗼𝗸𝗮𝘆? 𝗗𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘂𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗲? 𝗜𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗼, 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗶𝗱 𝗼𝗳𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝘂𝗽.

As the indulgent aroma of hot cocoa wafted up, the man licked his parched lips again. "If you don't want that I'll take i—"

He reached over.
Sarah flinched. 
He jerked back.

"Sorry, I didn't mean to—"
A photo slipped out of his trench coat and landed face up on the floor. It was a photo of a woman in a jeep. It was a photo of Sarah.

She squinted. "Is that me?"

"Shit." The man squatted down and snapped it up. "God, this isn't working."

"IS THAT ME?!" She screamed, snatching the photo out of his hand. 

In the picture, she was wearing some gaudy theme party outfit: a bandana with blown-out '80s hair. Something she'd never worn before.

"Where did you get this?!"

The man put up his hands. "Look, I know this isn't going well, but we only have one book on mating rituals in the future: Neil Strauss' The Game."

Sarah ripped the lid off the cup. "Tell me where you got this photo! Right now! Is this AI?! Are you stalking me?!"

Two male baristas flanked the counter. Time was running out. 

"Sarah, listen, please. You're the Mother of the Resistance. Your son John is destined to be humanity's savior."

"My son?!" Nothing this crazed hobo said made sense. "With who?"

The man gave a sheepish shrug. "With me."

A moment later, the hobo's howls of pain ripped through the cafe as the scalding hot cocoa seared his eyelids shut.

The two baristas dog-piled the man as he flopped on the floor, writhing in agony.

Sarah stepped back and bumped into what felt like a refrigerator.

"Are you Sarah Connor?" A thick, Austrian voice asked.

Sarah turned to find another freak in a trenchcoat towering over her. He too was clutching something under his coat.

𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑒. 𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟! Weirdos were coming out of the woodwork. She was at her wits' end.

"Yeah, I'm Sarah Connor!" She threw her arms wide. "Go ahead and whip it out!"
