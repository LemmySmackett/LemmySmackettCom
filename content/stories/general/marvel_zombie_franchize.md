"Dude, did you see the new Marvel show coming out?"

"Eh, I lost interest in everything after Endgame. It's not the same without the big three: Ironman, Captain America, Thor."

"Thor? We still have Thor!"

"Nah, he's dead too."

"Huh?"

"Taika Waititi killed him."

"Well, whatever man. Now they're all back!"

"Really?"

"Yep, as shambling corpses that refuse to die."

"That is the franchise, yes."

"It's Marvel Zombies, bro! All your family-friendly favorites return as rotting flesh-eating monstrosities!"

"That's...a direction."

"It's so good, bro. In the original comics, Spider-Man devours Aunt May alive."

"Okay."

"And Mary Jane!"

"Anything except marriage, eh Marvel?"

"And then he's morbidly distraught for the rest of the run!"

"I'm distraught just hearing it."

"The other zombified heroes mock him for being a mopey little whimp while they collectively scour the continents, killing and consuming the innocents they once swore to protect."

"Sounds like a rollicking good time."

"Oh, it is."

"How's it end?"

"You don't mind spoilers?"

"Everything's spoiled these days. Including the heroes..."

"Well, after devouring all life on earth, they consume Galactus himself and seize the cosmic power of flight, turning their ceaseless hunger loose upon the heavens."

"Lovely."

"I thought so."

"You know, there's a meta-commentary here on what the superhero genre has done to film and streaming."

"Hey man, look, it was either this or Captain Marvel 3."

"Go Marvel Zombies!"
