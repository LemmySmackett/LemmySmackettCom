The temperature of the waiting room was precisely calibrated, as all waiting rooms are calibrated, to be just below comfortable, but not so low as to prompt a person to put on a sweater or jacket, even if they had brought one.

In this way, the patients are made complicit in their own little miseries.

The door to the exam rooms swung open and a Medical Assistant in dark purple scrubs stepped through.

"Pinino?" She asked aloud. "Mr. Pinino?"

The people in the room, who sat as far and as equidistant from one another as possible, which is the right and proper etiquette, did not share glances. The man with lotus hole hands did not glance at the woman with the flaming skull. The woman with the flaming skull did not glance at the figure hunched in the corner.

"Mr. Pinino." The MA repeated in the flat tone of a woman who has had a thousand patients who don't seem to know their own damn name. "Two thirty appointment."

"Oh." The figure in the corner held up his hand and stood. "It's Pinero," he corrected meekly.

He was in his late twenties with short brown hair. Ethereal snakes lashed about in the open void hole of his stomach, their scales glittering with chromatic light.

"My apologies." The Medical Assistant stood to the side, holding the door wide. "This way please."

"Thank you," Pinero said, walking over. As he passed, one of the snakes snapped at the MA.

Startled, she pressed her body against the door.

"Ah, sorry."

She gave him a curt, professional smile. "Please step forward so we can take your weight and vitals." She motioned to the scale in the hall, careful to keep her hand as far from the snakes as possible.

The man nodded. "Okay."

As she followed Mr. Pinero, a heavy-set MA in pink scrubs passed them both.

"Aberdeen?" She called out into the waiting room. "Mrs. Aberdeen?"

The woman with the flaming skull opened her mouth and released a living cloud of screaming black smoke.

***

Pinero sat on the exam table, waiting for the doctor. His feet hung five inches above the tiled floor, as is the standard. Everything in the room was standard: the exam table, a computer terminal, cabinets full of PVE (protective void equipment), and a sink with an eye wash station. 

After ten minutes and 53 seconds, at the precise moment when Pinero thought for the third time that he really might leave, there was a knock and the door swung open. 

A blond-haired woman in her early forties briskly entered the room. "Good morning, Mr. Pinero. I'm Dr. Harper."

"Good Morning." Pinero extended his hand.

Dr. Harper ignored it and sat down at the computer. "Apologies, but I'll be keeping my distance. A matter of safety, I'm afraid."

Pinero looked down and noticed his void snakes fully extended toward Dr. Harper, their fangs dripping with venomous pitch. "Right." He lowered his hand. "My bad."

"No harm, no foul." Dr. Harper chirped. "What seems to be the trouble?"

Mr. Pinero shuffled his feet. "I haven't been feeling well."

Dr. Harper started typing on the keyboard. "Well, you're in the right place. Do you feel nauseous? Any coughing or fever?"

"I don't think so."

"Any pain or soreness?"

Pinero blinked and motioned to his stomach. The snakes hissed in unison. 

Dr. Harper smiled. "That's natural. Do you feel pain anywhere else?"

Pinero shrugged. "My back, sometimes. But it's probably just bad posture."

"Perhaps."

"I work at a computer all day," he added.

"Don't we all," Dr. Harper said, takking away at the keyboard. "How's your sleep?"

"Not great. The snakes like to move around. A lot."

"I bet. You'll have all kinds of problems if you don't get a full eight hours. I can prescribe a sleeping aid."

"Eh, I don't like being drowsy."

"These work differently. Instead of knocking you out, they act on your orexin receptors and limit wakefulness. I'll send a prescription to the pharmacy on file."

With dagger-like precision, Dr. Harper's fingers jabbed at the keys. Tak Tak Tak.

"Thank you." Pinero leaned forward. "I was hoping‚Äî"

"One moment."

Pinero leaned back and waited.

With the flair of a master pianist, Dr. Harper's fingers danced across the keyboard and stuck the landing on the enter key. "Done. Now what else?"

"Well, when the snakes really get slithering the pain is intense. Unbearable, really."

"And would you describe that as a pulsing pain or a stabbing pain?"

"I'm not sure. I just want to shove my hands in and shovel out my guts." He made an example motion as he said it.

Dr. Harper nodded in sympathy. "Intestinal Void Snakes is a tough condition for anyone to live with."

"Yeah."

"Have you considered a supernal ophidectomy?"

"That's what I wanted to ask about. My insurance doesn't cover it but if I save up, I might be able to get one in five years." Pinero paused. "But I've heard there are risks."

"There are," Dr. Harper said matter-of-factly. "The snakes are symbiotic parasites who've latched onto your empyrean form. There's a chance that the soul surgeon accidentally pulls out your leylines and severs the wavering band of light anchoring you to the sublime tapestry of all living things."

"That...sounds bad."

Dr. Harper nodded. "You'd be sublimated into a void wraith and pop right out of the terrestrial plane of existence. BLIP!" She made a popping hand motion as she said it.

"Um."

"And when you blip, the tear in reality would create a hyper-localized gravity well, smashing the surgeon and attending nurses into a giant blood lump, killing them instantly."

Pinero blinked.

"Pure agony for everyone involved, I'm told."

"Right," Pinero said uneasily. "So if it goes bad, I turn into a ghost?"

Dr. Harper chortled politely. "No, no, just a void wraith. Ghosts aren't real, Mr. Pinero."

"Even so, it sounds like I shouldn't get it done."

Dr. Harper waved him off. "Not at all. The risks are the risks and you should be aware of them, but thousands of people have successful surgery every year." She started typing again. "In the meantime, I can prescribe some pills for the pain. They're opioids, so you'll want to follow the dosage closely."

"Oh no, I wouldn't want to get addicted. I've been trying some, uh, home remedies." 

"Home remedies," The doctor repeated in a neutral, non-judgmental tone. "Such as?"

Pinero hesitated.

The doctor gave him a patient look.

"Liquid brain lichens," he finally said.

Dr. Harper made a note on the computer. "Very popular, these days. They come in a beaker and you pour them into your ear, yes?"

Pinero nodded.

"Right. I'm gonna go ahead and order an asomatous MRI. I must tell you that the research on brain lichens is spotty at best."

"I read a Snubstack on it."

"Uh huh. Have you noticed any side effects or anything unusual since you started using?"

Pinero thought for a moment. "Now that you mention it; sometimes, late at night, I hear singing from deep within my void hole."

"Does it sound like a siren song from the Abyssal Ridge or is it more like a dirge of the Infernal Bone Horrors?"

Pinero shrugged. "I'm not sure. It's faint. I guess I don't know the difference."

"That's fine. It would be hard for most people to tell them apart‚Äîat first, anyway. Just be sure to call if screaming mouths open between the folds of your toes.

Pinero gulped. "Right." 

"Anything else?"

He sighed. "I've been a bit depressed since my girlfriend left."

"I see. And when was that?"

"Last week."

"Sadly, there's no prescription for heartbreak." The doctor smiled softly.

"Well, we didn't break up exactly."

"Oh?"

"She crawled into my void hole while I was sleeping."

Dr. Harper nodded in a restrained, professional manner. "And you let her...?" 

Pinero put up his hands. "Oh no. When I woke up, her legs were already sticking out, and then FWIP!" Pinero wrapped his right hand around his left arm and rapidly pulled it down to demonstrate.

Dr. Harper's mask of professionalism remained. "Did she say anything?" 

"Um, right before the FWIP, she was screaming something about a song calling to her?"

Dr. Harper sucked her teeth. "Okay, then." She turned and started typed at the computer again. "Siren Song of the Abyssal Ridge, it is. You're going to want to stop taking the Brain Lichens."

"Really?" Pinero was deflated. "They cost a fortune. I had to order them from Malaysia..."

"Well, Mr. Pinero, the song will only grow louder, so unless you want your neighbors breaking into your house and crawling inside you at all hours of the night, I recommend ùë†ùë°ùëúùëù-ùëùùëñùëõùëî." She accented the last word with a sing-song voice.

"I see." A look of worry crossed Pinero's face, the kind a person gets when they realize they've left the stove on at home. "Is my girlfriend okay?" He asked.

Dr. Harper stopped typing and thought for a moment. "Well, if she made it to the ridge, she's been transubstantiated into a new form and now sings eternal with her abyssal sisters."

"Oh." Pinero took a moment to process this information.  "Does that hurt?"

"It's a life," Dr. Harper shrugged. "She'll never return to this plane of existence though, so I'd consider you guys effectively broken up."

Pinero's shoulders fell. "Oh."

Dr.Harper looked at him and sighed. "Do you live with anyone? Have any family nearby?"

Pinero shook his head. "I had a cat but..."

"Void snakes?" Dr. Harper guessed.

"Void Snakes," Pinero confirmed.

"You're condition can be difficult to manage,  Mr. Pinero. It's normal to have feelings of hopelessness and depression. Since you're  alone, I'm going to prescribe an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, as a preventative measure." Dr. Harper turned to the computer, her hands dancing on the keyboard again. "I'll throw in an antianxiety while we're at it."

Tak tak tak.

Tak tak tak. 

Tak tak tak.

She spun back. "Well, I think that does it for today. If you need anything else, let us know, okay?"

As Pinero headed out, he stopped at the checkout desk. The receptionist wore red scrubs and had gentle doe eyes with winged tadpoles swimming in the sclera.

"Today's co-pay is 30 milliliters," she said.

Pinero took a ceremonial letter opener from the pen holder on the desk, sliced open his right palm, and squeezed his outstretched fist. Droplets of cool shimmering light splattered on the payment tray.

"You have a beautiful color," the receptionist marvelled. 

"Thanks," Pinero said. "I like your eyes," he quickly added.

Pinero and the receptionist looked at one another, genuinely looked, the way people so rarely do. Together, they blushed.

Meanwhile, a man with squid tentacles tearing through his neck ran screaming out of the nearest exam room and was immediately tackled by the MAs in pink and purple.

"Drink from the endless well," he screamed. "The shrine is made of icepicks and the heart is not enough. To the void, we return!"  

With a certain dramatic flair, he tore off his own head and flung it across the hall, where it landed with a sickening splotch on the cold tile. The tentacles righted the head and carried it, still babbling, into the bathroom, where it attempted to flush itself down the toilet.

"Get Dr. Harper," the MA in purple called out as she chased the head.

"Ya'll ain't pay me enough for this!" The MA in pink yelled, still grappling with the flailing, headless body.

"You like coffee?" Pinero asked the receptionist in red, paying no mind to the chaos around him.

"I do," she mischievously grinned. "But only if it's bitter as sin and black as hell."
