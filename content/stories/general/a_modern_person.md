Third-year college student Toby Greer walks into his apartment kitchen. "Dude this AI AutoReader garbage still blows my mind. Who the hell wants to sit around reading AI-generated summaries? You might as well let the damn thing eat for you to—" He freezes. "What is that?"

His roommate, freshman exchange student Samir Patel, sits at the dining room table. A buzzard of gunmetal steel and white polycarbonate, the size of a mini-fridge, squats on a large perch freshly bolted to the center of the countertop. Its long, crooked neck shifts as servos whine and sockets pivot, its red eye optics snapping to Toby.

Samir looks up. "It's like audiobooks, right?"

"What?" Paralyzed by confusion, Toby can't tear his eyes away from the mechanized monstrosity.

"The AI AutoReader," Samir says. "It's like Audible, right?"

"No man. It's totally different, it's uh..." Toby trails off.

Samir smiles, patiently waiting for his roommate to complete his thought.

"It's, uh, it's—Samir."

"Hm?"

"What the hell am I looking at?"

"Oh, this?" Samir gestures to the new centerpiece.

"Yeah, that," Toby says. "The freaky Beaky Buzzard bot staring me down. And did you bolt a fuckin' perch onto my fuckin' brand new BJURSTA Ikea table?"

The buzzard's optics twitch and shift.

"You like it?" Samir grins. "It just arrived in the mail. It's a prototype!"

"A prototype?"

Samir nods. "I pledged $2000 on the Kickstarter. It's the latest in pre-digestive autonomous alimentary technology."

Toby stares.

"It's a Roomba for mastication."

"It...eats for you?'

"Uh-huh." Samir nods. "It suffuses the food with synthetic hydrolytic enzymes using the power of ChymeAI. And it can add in any supplements you wish too, like Creatine. Or Yohimbine!"

"You're kidding."

"No, Toby, I never kid," Samir says. "I am not a goat."

"Uh, so what's it called?"

"Regurri. By UpChow."

"Regurri?" Toby cocks a brow. "And people buy this?"

"Oh yes." Samir nods. "Tons of new start-ups working in the AI-powered BPaaS space these days."

"BPaas space?"

"Bolus-Prep as a Service."

Toby shakes his head. "Gonna be honest, Samir. You're hitting me with a lot right now."

"Ha! Oh, Toby, it is always you who is the goat."

"Uh."

"Here, let me show you." Samir reaches under the table and pulls out his backpack. "To start, we feed the Regurri. Fortunately, I stopped by my favorite restaurant today, 7-11—like I do every day."

Samir reaches into the bag, pulls out a 7-11 Big Bite hot dog carton, and sets it on the table. Then he pulls another and stacks it. And then another. 

Seven cartons high, Toby asks: "Samir, why the hell did you buy so many Big Bites?"

Samir looks up. "Hm?"

"It's cheaper to buy hot dogs in bulk. You know, at Wal-Mart?" 

"And miss out on the charm of authentic American cuisine?" The delighted Indian beams. "Don't be ridiculous, Toby."

"..."

"Now, we simply feed our meal into the Regurri." Samir opens a Big Bite carton and offers it to the buzzard. The bird of prey and pabulation tilts its angular beak and snatches the hot dog, shredding the carton. 

Toby recoils. "Jesus, that's creepy."

Samir offers the rest of the Big Bites and says, "Now a high-power blender in the belly of the Regurri purées the hot dogs at 50,000 RPMs, while adding the enzymes."

A high-pitched whine emanates from within the buzzard while a twinkling rendition of Die Forelle by Franz Schubert plays. 

"I think I'm having a dissociative episode," Toby mumbles.

In sync, the whine and Die Forelle end.

"And now we eat!" 

Samir merrily tilts his head back and opens his mouth wide. The buzzard leans forward, seizes Samir's cheeks between its steel mandibles, and projectile vomits the enzyme-enriched 7-11 hot dog slurry straight down his throat.

𝙃𝙐𝙐𝘼𝘼𝘼𝙂𝙃!!

Toby gags and clamps his mouth, turning away. "Oh God."

"It's great!" Samir chokes out, eyes watering. "You should try it, Toby!" 

"I'm good, man."

"It's the wave of the future, Toby. We can't resist the future!" Once more, the buzzard vomits. Trapped by the mandibles, Samir's body jerks and shudders, struggling to keep pace with dinner.

𝙃𝙃𝙐𝙐𝘼𝘼𝙂𝙂𝙃𝙃𝙃𝙃!!

"Jesus Christ, Samir. Enough!" Toby shouts over the synchronized retching of man and machine. "How do we turn it off?!"

"What will be will be, Toby!" Samir gasps, a mix of saliva, bile, and hot dog dribbling down his chin. "We must embrace it, as it embraces us!"

Toby tilts his head away, unable to look. "Dude, the only thing I want to embrace right now is an emesis bag." 

"Ah, that's the difference between you and me, Toby. You're an old goat. A Luddite!" Samir declares. "Unlike me."

"Unlike you huh?"

"That's right, Toby! I happen to be a modern per—"
