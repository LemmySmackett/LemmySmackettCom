My, my, my," the Succubus purred. "I guess even a holy man can't resist tying up a bad girl."

The scarlet demoness lay bound to the temple floor, arms and legs splayed wide, wrists and ankles pulled taut by thick, coarse rope.

She tested the restraints and found they offered little slack. Good. If there was one thing she hated in a man, it was half ass work. Flaccidness. Now there was a real sin.

Her captor towered above, a blonde lad in flowing black robes, holy book in hand.

She gave him a smouldering glance. "Enjoying the view?'

Save for a single thin sash covering her most unholy of holies, she was nude from devilish head to demonic toe - a voluptuous vessel of carnal delight born to tempt men into the gaping mouth of hell itself.

The Priest grimaced. "Silence, Concubine of Cambions." His tone was stern, aiming for gravitas, but falling just a hair short—his voice, a tad too reedy.

"Mm, I could never do the concubine thing. Too much commitment."

The Priest huffed. "Shameless Harlot of Gehenna."

He had the virile scent of a man, but he was too young to pull off the commanding demeanor. Maybe in a decade or two, she thought.

By his nerves and eagerness, she guessed he was fresh from the monastery. The highly wound, overly-aspiring sort that took their studies far too seriously. She licked her lips, imagining what it would be like to drain those clogged, uptight balls.

He looked down at her with nothing but contempt. "Even in the face of retribution, you are devoid of modesty—nearly beyond salvation."

"Mmm, I love when you boys talk dirty," she taunted. "Oh, I know." The Succubus lifted her hips and gyrated in a slow, sinuous rhythm. "How about you spit in my cunt while calling me a Strumpet of Styx? Or maybe a Madame of Malebolge?

"Hmph." The Priest spun on his heel and marched to a nearby counter.

The Succubus tittered. Such a handsome little bastard, she mused. It was almost a shame she'd have to suck his saintly scepter until his withered body crumpled in a spent husk and his shriveled eyes rolled out of his skull. But that was the beautiful thing about the Church: they always sent more priests.

He returned with a truncheon in one hand and a vial of dark liquid in the other.

"Oh my. Are we going to get a little rough?" She eyed the long, wooden club. "If you want to know my safe word, it's 'Harder Father.'"

"Make a mockery while you can," he sneered. "This vial contains Blessed Oil from the Arch-Bishop's olive groves."

For the first time, the Succubus' smirk faltered. It was all fun and games until they brought out the blessed shit.

The Succubus shifted warily. "Look, if you want to knock me around a bit, that's fine. I can take it."

The Priest tilted the truncheon horizontally and drizzled the oil over it.

"Seriously! You can punch me in the face! Give me a black eye! Break a few teeth! Anything but that!"

Frantic, the Succubus jerked and yanked at the restraints. Why did he have to tie these ropes so damn tight anyway?

The Priest knelt between her legs, speaking in a calm, measured toned. "As a temptress of men, the source of your demonic corruption lay within the quim. Forgive me. I have no choice but to purify your body at the source."

The Priest lifted the sheer silk sash with one hand, aimed the tip of the truncheon, and averted his gaze.

"H-hey! At least watch what you're doing!" She yelped. "Do you even know where to stick it?!"

As a chaste man of God, he absolutely didn't.

The Priest clenched his eyes and thrust the truncheon forward. Having no practical experience with female anatomy, his aim ran low and, worst coming to worst, the hard, slickened tip penetrated her puckered hellhole.

An ear-piercing shriek erupted from the Succubus, rattling the temple down to its very foundations.

There were two mind-rending layers to the pain. The first was the sudden assault on her tender, unprepared sin-bloom. The second was an unbearable burning sensation from the Blessed Oil, a feeling that could only be described as having minty fresh ghost peppers shoved up your ass.

"T-this is for your own good!" The Priest stammered, his eyes still clenched. "Please endure it!"

He continued to work the truncheon, mercilessly pumping it into her tight hole over and over. The Succubus writhed and convulsed, her ass gripping the ruthless intruder for dear life.

In her ten thousand years on earth, she had never been subjected to such barbaric treatment. This was torture. Humiliation. Degradation. Abuse. It was the worst thing that had ever happened to her. And she was loving every second of it.

"Harder," she choked through tears. "Faster."

As the waves of ecstasy and agony flooded her body, cresting and crashing within, the thought occured that he might actually kill her. So be it. She couldn't think of a better way to go. Hell, she couldn't think of anything at all.

"I'm trying!" The Priest shouted in earnest, hammering away with all his might, unaware that he was giving this masochistic bitch just what she wanted.

"Break me!" She cried. "Break my ass!" The Succubus' body arched, the pleasures of torment having driven her to the edge of release.

"Your ass?" The Priest halted, his brow pinched in confusion.

"Fuck!" The Succubus screamed, lifting her hips. Her raised pussy clenched and spasmed, the folds of her fiendish fissure undulating in a mesmerizing dance for him and him alone. The Priest could only stare, as if looking upon the face of God himself, and was still staring when she unleashed, blasting his pious face with a barrage of pressurized squirts.

He remained slackjawed, chin dripping wet, as her hips wobbled and flopped onto the soiled stone. Her legs went on twitching from passing fits.

A hushed silence fell upon the temple.

With quivering fingers, the Priest reached for the vial. A slender red hand suddenly seized his wrist.

The priest gulped. In the obscene frenzy, the ropes had frayed and severed.

She pulled in close, her breath hot and ragged upon his blushing cheek. Her fingernail traced the artery in his neck.

"I was going to suck your cock until your heart stopped." She cooed, drawing a line of blood across his clavicle. "But I've changed my mind. And you don't mind spending a little more time with a woman of indecorous inclinations. Do you?"

Wide-eyed, the Priest shook his head. He stared at her with a gaze that bordered on reverence.

"That's what I thought." She wrapped her hand around his throat, forked tongue flickering in his ear. "Now stop gawking like a stunned deer and fuck my ass again, sweet priest."
