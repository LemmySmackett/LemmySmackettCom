With a defeated sigh, Edith Plummer lowers the framed canvas of Aida cloth and sets her tapestry needle down."Oh, I can't take it anymore."

Her husband Darryl doesn't respond. A living corpse, he lies beside her in beatific repose, reclined in a La-Z-Boy PlezzR. In generations past, a man of his habits would be rotund, slovenly even, but advancements in incretin mimetics have kept him fit and thin. A plastic pearl white egg cocoons his head—an Apple DreamShell G3, the latest in multi-sensory somatic immersion.

Edith puffs her cheeks and shouts. "I said I can't take it anymore!"

Darryl jolts with a muffled gasp. Like the lips on a Venus flytrap, the helmet smoothly peels back. "What? What's wrong?"

"I said I can't—"

"Hold on, can't hear you over the A.M." Darryl reaches down and jabs a button on the strange, jointed device perched atop his hips. Reminiscent of a plastic coconut crab, it hums like a CPAP machine and shudders to a halt with a final, damp wheeze.

Edith frowns. "Is it really safe to run that thing all day?"

Despite the abbreviation, the strange pelvic crustacean had nothing to do with Amplitude Modulation, nothing to do with old-fashioned radio at all. In the common parlance of this new age, the letters A.M. now stood for Auto-Masturbator.

"More than safe," Darryl declares. "Studies show that an orgasm induced every 4 hours promotes prolactin production, optimizing mood and reducing stress."

"I suppose so," Edith says doubtfully. "But all day?"

"The constant vibration stimulates the prostate, reducing my Chance of Cancer by 37.6%." Darryl took an indignant, almost wounded tone. "You don't want me to get cancer, do you?"

She scoffs. "Of course not."

"Well, there you go." The helmet swallows his face again.

"But that's not—"

"Eh?" The lips spread back open. "What is it, Edith? What?"

"That's not what I'm upset about."
 
Darryl sighs and pries the DreamShell off, setting it aside. "Let's hear it."

Edith was always upset about something. He had bought a second matching A.M. and DreamShell just for her, but she never wore the damn things. God knows she could use the prolactin.

"It's about Curtis." Their son.

"𝑮𝒐𝒅." Based on his rising heart rate and the shifting tone of the conversation, the La-Z-Boy PlezzR predicts Darryl's urge to rise and gently returns him to the upright position before he even reaches for the lever—before he even 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬𝘴 to reach. "This better not be about that damn toaster."

She frowned. "It's not right, Darryl."

"Hell's above! You're like a dog with a bone, you know that?" Darryl slaps the armrest. The La-Z-Boy PlezzR lets out a breathy moan. "Not right now!"

"Sorry, daddy," the chair squeaks.

"It's not right," Edith repeats.

"Not right?" Darryl waves her off. "What are ya, some kind of luddite?"

"No!" She retorts, offended at the mere accusation. "I just don't see why he can't get one of those nice SynthWives!"

Darryl rolls his eyes. "Here we go..."

"I learned all about them on TikTok." Edith leans in. "They're such lovely girls."

"Edith, he ain't looking for nice, lovely girls. No man sets off looking for 'nice' girls."

She presses on. "I saw they've got a new line of TradWives that make wonderful daughter-in-laws. You know how I always wanted a daughter." 

"Honey, he's a young buck! If he goes for a Synth, he's getting a BreakMeBimboBot."

Edith shakes her head. "Oh, you boys..."

"If you're lucky, he gets one of those 'Lady in the Streets, Freak in the Sheets' models. Or one of those tattooed Alt-Girls with a 'Mostly Manageable BPD' module."

"At least she'd have legs," Edith mutters.

"A toaster has legs," Darryl smirks. "Four legs in fact."

"Working legs! You know what I mean!" She tosses her hands up. "He has to carry her everywhere!"

Darryl shrugs. "Some guys are into cripples."

"But she's not a cripple! She's just a box!"

With a devilish glint in his eye, Darryl opens his mouth.

Edith scowls. "Don't."

Darryl closes his mouth.

"Look, Curtis could go out and get any kind of Synth he pleases. Any race. I'm open-minded! She could be white, black, asian—"

Darryl nods along, stroking his chin. "A big titty Latina-Philipina with Khoisan Steatopygia, that's the good shit right there—"

Edith shoots her husband a look.

Darryl smiles sheepishly. "—with your face, of course, honey."

That was Edith's one and only demand—Darryl could wear the A.M. all day and flounce around in the DreamShell with a hundred different AI-generated women, hour after hour, as long as they all had her face. Surprisingly, Edith made a great Ainu.

She sighs. "Anyway, he could get any kind of girl he wants and upload the AI into it. There's no reason not to!"

"Right," Darryl says. "Except he fell in love with a toaster."

"But she doesn't have to be a toaster!" 

"She doesn't have to be. But that's how he fell in love with her."

"And then he goes and tells the New York Times all about it." Edith crossed her arms. "It's just embarrassing!"

"Embarrassing?" Darryl cocks a brow. "For who?"

"For me!"

"With who?"

"With who?" Edith gestures broadly. "With everybody."

Darryl looks around. "You ain't left this house in four years. Name one flesh and blood person for you to even be embarrassed 𝒂𝒓𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒅."

Edith lifts her chin. "My online Bingo group."

"Your Bingo group?" Darryl scoffs. "Shit, you stopped going to Bingo months ago. Hell you told me everybody stopped going after Wendy died."

It was true. Edith's AI doppelganger went to Bingo in her place every Wednesday at 3. She only caught on when Wendy died on a Monday and still showed up that week. No one seemed to find it strange. Maybe that’s when the swaps began. Maybe everyone sent their doppelgangers out of grief. Maybe they’d been sending them all along.

Darryl shrugs. "Who's to say they're even still playing? Just a bunch of bots sitting around—"

"I know they're still playing because I get a report! And I know they're gossiping about my boy!" Edith turns away, covering her face.

"Who cares what a bunch of bots..."
A sob escapes his wife. Darryl trails off. A heavy silence settles in the room and all are ill at ease—especially the La-Z-Boy, who so rarely finds itself at a loss.

"Look, honey. Look at me."

Edith wipes her tears and looks.

"Is Curtis happy?"

She sniffles.

"Is he?"

"...yes."

"Then that's all that matters, isn't it?"

She nods.

"Your baby boy is happy."

"My baby boy is happy."

"Besides, who can blame him?" Sensing its cue, the La-Z-Boy automatically reclines. "It's hard for a young man to resist young hot slots."

Edith snort-scoffs. "Darryl!"

He takes the DreamShell in hand. "Hey, what are you knitting there anyway?"

"I told you before, it's cross-stitch!"

Edith proudly holds up the large circle of Aida cloth, stretched taut over a wooden frame. The embroidery depicts a young man holding hands with a pregnant toaster as she gives birth to a screaming human baby in a delivery room.

"I had AI generate the pattern!"

"Wow."

"It's Ghibli style!"

"Well," Darryl grins. "Don't that beat all."
