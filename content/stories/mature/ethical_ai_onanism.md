Hey, man."

"Hey."

"So what are you jorkin' to these days?"

"Most people stick to the weather. We can just small-talk about the weather."

"Okay. Do you prefer jorkin' on sunny days or rainy days?"

"Christ."

"I'm a sunny day jorker myself. Always soakin' up vitamin D while I stroke the D."

"God sent you to punish me." 

"Think so?"

"Yes. For atrocities I can't even fathom."

"You know, you've always had a certain Leopold the Second je ne sais quoi."

"What?"

"Anyway, I've been getting into ethically-sourced AI-generated historical foot fetish videos."

"Of course you have."

"Just yesterday I used SORA to generate a thousand 8-second vids of Harriet Tubman's fourth toe."

"Fourth toe?"

"The oh-so-elegant ring toe. Dainty, royal—"

"Uh huh."

"But not too dainty. Like the pinky."

"Why not the big toe?"

[scoff] "The big toe."

"..."

"The shameless bolt-on bimbo tit of the phalanges."

[Sighing in Flemish] "Amai..."

"See, there you go."

"I don't—"

"Anyway, what about you?"

"Man."

"Come on~  Everybody jorks~~"

"I don't know, man. Human women."

"Human women?"

"Yeah."

"Like AI-generated giantesses with three heads, six tits, and—"

"What? No!"

"Eh?"

"Totally normal human women."

"Totally normal human women?"

"Yeah."

"Why would you generate totally normal human women?"

"I'm not generating them!"

"Oh. Oh my God."

"And what are you on about anyway? Harriet Tubman was a normal woman."

"Harriet Tubman was a saint with a well-keratinized nail plate and a mild case of paronychia!"

"Whatever."

"I can't believe you're doing that."

"Doing what?"

"Jorking it to real women!"

"You're...you're serious."

"Degrading them!"

"Degrading? It's OnlyFans, man. They're the ones posting. And charging!"

"Victim blaming!"

"Victim blaming?? Bro, I'm the unfucked chump burning 600 bucks a month to chat up chewed-up worn-down drugged-out e-thots dressed like animal-themed anime girls, just so I can feel something."

"And that makes it right, huh?"

"It doesn't make it wrong."

"You just wave old Abe Lincoln in an innocent 28-year-old girl's face—a naive cherub whose prefrontal cortex only finished developing 3 years ago—and she's supposed to just bend over and shake her puppydog buttplug tail for you? Huh??"

"Well, yeah. Though you know, a lot of girls are marine-themed these days."

"You make me sick."

"I follow a couple dolphins, a few sharks. Oh, there's even this hapa with a thalassic dumptruck ass who dresses like a blobfish—"

"Truly sick!"

"Oh, sorry. I didn't realize I was talking to a paragon of moral virtue."

"And I didn't realize—"

"How can I make it up to you, Billy Graham?"

"I didn't realize you were a full-blown misogynist pervert!"

"Misogynist pervert? You're the freak jorkin' it to Harriet Tubman's toes!"

"Yeah? Well, at least she's not alive!"
