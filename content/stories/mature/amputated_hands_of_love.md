Two young men sit on a well-worn pleather couch, holding PlayStation controllers.

"Bro, those transplants look sick," Trevor says. "I still can't believe you lost both hands at Islands of Adventure."

Paul sighs. "Man, I gotta be the only idiot in the world to get double amputated by 𝐷𝑜𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝐷𝑜𝑜𝑚'𝑠 𝐹𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 'cause I was squeezin' my girl's ass."

"To be fair, they do say to keep both hands in the ride at all times."

"Yeah," Paul says, glancing at the foreign appendages stapled to his wrist.

"But also to be fair, your girlfriend's ass is extremely squeezable."

"Hey!" Paul raises his fist in mock anger.

Trevor presses on, grinning. "But it's all good, bro! You're here now—the Modelos are cold, the Domino's meat lovers deep dish is hot, and I got Mortal Kombat 1."

"Because it's full of brutal amputations and my hands got amputated."

"Haha, yeah!"

"I get it."

"Dude, dude, I gotta ask," Trevor leans in, lowering his voice. " Have you given them a full test run yet?"

Paul's expression darkens. "It's been hell. Physical therapy is the most difficult thing I've ever had to do. But I can open a jar of peanut butter now so-"

"No, no, no, listen, listen, c'mere." Trevor wraps his arm around Paul's neck and pulls him in.

"...what?" Paul asks with more than a little trepidation.

Trevor brings his bearded lips to Paul's ear and whispers: "Have you jerked off with them yet?"

"NO!" Paul shouts, shoving Trevor away.

"Hahaha! Bro! You totally have!" Trevor falls out, kicking his legs in the air.

"What am I supposed to do?!" Paul spits defensively. "Never jerk off again?"

"Bro, bro, bro, you gotta tell me: does it feel gay?"

Paul averts his eyes."Well..."

"Bro? It totally feels gay, doesn't it? It's another dude's hands on your dong, bro!"

"Look, can I tell you something? Something you can't tell anyone else?"

Trevor straightens up. "Of course, bro."

"Not even my girlfriend."

Trevor crosses his heart and then adds in some Catholic-ish gestures. "Sworn to secrecy, bro. I'm like the Grail Knight in Indiana Jones."

Paul takes a deep breath and exhales. "Do you remember in Metal Gear Solid 4 when Revolver Ocelot is possessed by Liquid Snake's transplanted arm and becomes Liquid Ocelot?"

"Actually," Trevor says. "By the time Metal Gear Solid 4 rolls around, Ocelot has replaced Liquid Snake's arm with a bionic one."

Paul blinks. "What? Really?"

"Yeah, and then get this—he uses hypnosis to trick himself into thinking he's being possessed by the transplanted arm he doesn't even have anymore to fool the authoritarian AI system that has taken over the world."

Paul rubs his forehead. "Wait, so he was never possessed by the arm?"

"No bro, that's the crazy part. He was totally possessed by the arm in MGS2, because we found out he was The Sorrow's kid in MGS3, and he partially inherited his father's ability to commune with the souls of the dead. But by MGS4, all that is gone and it's just the bionic arm."

Paul sits back, taking it all in. "That's so dumb."

"Hideo Kojima is an auteur, bro. Like Tarantino. I can't wait for DS2."

"Alright so, anyway—in MGS2, Liquid is possessing Ocelot through the arm."

"Right, right, right."

"And like, I know this doesn't make sense, but sometimes I feel that with these hands. Like there's a spirit trapped inside them."

"Bro, really?"

Paul nods.

"That's so creepy, bro. That's some Five Nights at Freddy's shit."

"Yeah, and I can fill the spirit strongest when I'm jerking off."

Trevor stares at Paul. "...what?"

"It's the way they caress me, man. I've never fondled my balls like this before."

Trevor recoils. "Bro! I don't need to hear how you handle the equipment!"

"But that's not the worst part. Because as much as these hands yearn to touch me, they yearn to touch you more."

Paul leans over and cups Trevor's cheeks in his palms.

"Bro, I am freaking out right now."

"I'm glad Doctor Doom took my hands," Paul says, gazing into Trevor's eyes. "Because I fear I've fallen for you."
