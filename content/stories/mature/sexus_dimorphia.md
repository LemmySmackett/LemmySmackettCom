"Hello human and welcome to our world, Sexus Dimorphia."

"Well that seems like an odd name for a plane-JESUS CHRIST!"

"Ah, I see you've spotted one of our females. And a fine specimen, at that."

"She's huge!"

"Yes, the women of our species used to be dainty, wide-hipped waifs with heavy, bulbous chest udders, much like the ones you have back home."

"I'm not sure if that description is misogynist or-"

"But after centuries of high-minded eugenic selection, even the smallest of our women could crush your Mr. Universe like an ant."

"Uh huh. And how are your men handling it?"

"Fortunately our race-wide fetish for gargantuan women arose in perfect harmony with our enlightened ethical awakening."

"Uh huh."

"Sadly, it's not all giant, rippling roses."

"Why's that?"

"Well, it's a little embarrassing, but the puny men of my species always begin the mating ritual by performing cunnilingus with our heads locked between the meaty, corded thighs of our lovers."

"Yeah, not surprised."

"And in this way, we have become victims of our own success."

"Victims?"

"Yes, you see, the men of Sexus Dimorphia perform cunnilingus so well that when the women orgasm and clench their burly muscles, the head is inevitably popped like a watermelon.

"..."

"I fear birth rates have been plummeting. ðŸ˜”"
