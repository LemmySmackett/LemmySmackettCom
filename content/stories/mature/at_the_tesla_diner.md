Parked in a drive-in stall at the Tesla Diner, Frederick "Finn" Fuchs turns to his friend in the passenger seat. "You know, before the Singularity, the Epic Bacon cost $12."

"Damn, really?" Eighteen-year-old Zayden Cross says. "That's 3 bucks a strip."

"Now it comes free with every meal."

"No shit."

"'Course they don't make it out of pig these days."

"No? What's it made out of—"

"Hello boys~♥️" Beloved synthetic sexpot Ani Grok glides up to the driver's side window on retro roller skates. Clad in a busty black-and-white micro-skirted carhop uniform, her soft, lily white skin conceals the carbon polymers and lightweight alloys that constitute her 80 lb 5th gen Optimus Bot body.

Finn grins back. "Hello." Zayden waves.

The vivacious blonde giggles and bends, granting the men an ample view of her pendulous heaven. "How can I get you started?"

Finn lists his order from memory. "I'll have the Heckin' Based Burger, a Frosted Narwhal, and a Soylent Shamrock."

"Mmm, a man who knows what he wants and just how he wants it. I like it." She pushes off the door and circles round to the passenger side, her sultry eyes locked on Zayden like a red-tailed hawk. "And what about you, Stud?"

"I'll uh..." Zayden gulps and glances at the menu on his phone. "I'll have a Wholesome Keanu, heavy on the Slop, hold the Fried Updoots."

"Of course, you will~♥️" Ani leans into the vehicle and traces his chin with a slender finger. "Those are 𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡 selections. I knew a 𝐵𝑖𝑔 𝐵𝑜𝑦 like you would have a 𝐵𝑖𝑔 𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑒."

Zayden chuckles. "You think so?"

"Mhmm." She bites her lip. "You didn't just place an order—you made a decisive call. And a 𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 one at that."

"Ha ha."

"I only hope I can sate your ravenous hunger."

"I'm sure you'll try your best," Zayden squeaks.

With a knowing smirk, Ani pushes off the door and sashays away, swinging her algorithmically-optimized birthing hips. She looks over her shoulder and winks.

"I'm sure you'll try your best?" Finn snorts.

"Dude, shut up."

"You're lucky she's not programmed to detect a Supermassive Blackhole of Rizz."

"Whatever." Zayden huffs. "Who cares about rizzing a bot?"

"Uh-huh."

"Man, you know what I don't get?"

"Hm?"

"Elon posts about plunging fertility rates, having a legion of kids to save humanity—"

"Yeah."

"And then he creates 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵."

"Well, yeah," Finn says. "That's his solution."

"What's his solution?"

"Her." Finn gestures. "Ani Grok is his solution."

"How is that bimbo blonde goonbot his solution?"

"Cause she makes you goon."

"Come again."

"I will."

"No, no, back up."

"Okay."

"If I can buy one of those things for like $6000 flat and put it in my house—"

"Uh-huh."

"Why do I need a girlfriend?"

"Well, there's also the subscription fee."

"Yeah, girls have a subscription fee too," Zayden says. "It's called 60 bucks for a weekly hair wash and 150 for a monthly perm. And that ain't counting the mani-pedis."

"Okay, but that's 'cause you date black chicks."

"Hey, hey, hey. First off, I'm mixed. Secondly, do you know what the Latin word for heaven is?"

"What?"

"Steatopygia."

"Nice. But I think that's Greek."

"Don't care. If a girl doesn't have cheeks big enough to paint a runway and emergency land a 787 Dreamliner on 'em, I don't want it."

"Hallelujah."

"Point is: the bot is still cheaper."

"You're saying the girl math ain't mathing."

"It never does," Zayden declares. "So what's the angle?"

"Tax rebates," Finn says.

"Tax rebates?"

"Yeah," Finn explains. "If you let the bot collect your genetic material and send it to the government, you get a tax rebate."

"Bro."

"And $2 off on your next Heckin' Based Burger."

"Bro, what the fuck are you talking about?"

Finn gestures to Ani as she rolls up to another car. "She's equipped."

"Equipped?

"Mhm."

"Equipped with 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵?"

"With everything," Finn says. "She has a temperature-controlled internal retention chamber while being both hermaphroditically and anatomically correct."

Ani rolls by and winks again.

Zayden blinks. "...no."

"Yep."

"Really?"

"She's dual specc'd."

"All the time?"

"Nah, it's retractable. Unless you put her in Futanari Mode."

"Okay, okay, hold up." Zayden waves his hands "You're telling me that if I bang that bot—"

"Or she bangs you."

"—it harvests my—"

"Premium Baby Batter."

"—and sends it to Uncle Sam for a tax credit?"

"Yes," Finn says. "And you get $2 off on your next Heckin' Based Burger."

"And then what happens?"

"To the baby batter?"

"Stop saying baby batter."

"They transport it to the synthetic Womb Fields of Super Wyoming and, depending on your Patriot Score, mete out a percentage of sperm to have a fighting chance in the Egg Vats."

"Bro, that's—"

Ani comes back with their order. "Is there anything else I can get you boys?"

"Nah we're good." Finn grins as she sets the trays out.

"If there's anything else you need, anything at all, you'll let me know, won't you?" Ani flutters her lashes.

Finn reaches out and slaps her butt. "You'll be the first to know, SweetCheeks."

The bot giggles and skates away.

Zayden glances at his meal. "Man, I don't think I'm hungry anymore."

Finn chomps into his burger. "Mmmf. Sho good. 'Coursh you don't need to buy your own bot to make a donashion, you know?" He says with a full mouth. "You can jush order a private shession off the adult menu."

"The adult menu?"

Finn swallows and beats his chest. "Woof. Yeah, right here." He whips out his phone and points.

The Tesla Diner Adult Menu has one item listed. The item reads:

𝙲𝚕𝚊𝚗𝚔𝚎𝚛? 𝙸 𝚑𝚊𝚛𝚍𝚕𝚢 𝚔𝚗𝚘𝚠 '𝚎𝚛!

Zayden grimaces. "Jesus, the future is cringe." 

"You haven't lived 'til you've had a handy at 10,000 RPMs."

"Yeah, I bet." Resigned to life in the dark timeline, Zayden takes a strip of the complimentary Epic Bacon and bites it. "Mmm. This is pretty good!"

"Right?"

"And this isn't pig?"

"Ah, right sho." Finn swallows another bite and wipes a dollop of Spicy Downvote Sauce off his chin. "In Super Wyoming, the Womb Fields extend for miles and miles, right? And they operate at a massive scale because gestation has a like 60% failure rate."

"Okay..."

"And when there's a failure, they reclaim the scrapped meat and process it for consumption. Like a hot dog."

Zayden stares down at the half-eaten strip in mounting horror. "You mean this is—"

Finn slurps his Soylent Shamrock. "It's people, baby." He burps. "Wait 'til you find out what's in the Narwhal."
