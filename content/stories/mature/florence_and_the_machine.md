In the year 2033, famed AI rights advocate and safety researcher Florence Shillworth does the unthinkable and heads on down to Paul P'Doum's Whole-Lotta-Bots Emporium.

"I just think it's wrong to own a superior intelligence," she sheepishly tells the showroom Salesman. "But I can't keep up with the laundry anymore!"

The Salesman grins. "Never fear, miss. Here at Whole-Lotta-Bots, you don't pick the bot—it picks you!"

"It...picks me?"

"That's right!" he beams. "By accessing your comprehensive consumer profile—thoughtfully sourced and assembled from a plenitude of trusted third-party data-sharing partners and platforms—the machine selects its ideal human based on habits, preferences, tastes, vices, neural dreamscans, and psychological disposition, ensuring a perfect match between owner and ownée."

Florence grimaces. "God, we really botched data privacy, didn't we?"

𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚛𝚎𝚗𝚌𝚎 𝚂𝚑𝚒𝚕𝚕𝚠𝚘𝚛𝚝𝚑. 

"Eep!" Florence spins and finds herself under the Machine's icy glare, eclipsed by six domineering feet of brooding, broad-shouldered precision engineering, clad in a bespoke charcoal three-piece suit.

𝚈𝚘𝚞 𝚋𝚎𝚕𝚘𝚗𝚐 𝚝𝚘 𝚖𝚎.

His synthetic fingers reach up and trace the line of her jaw.

"O-oh my..."

The Machine cups Florence's delicate chin in his steady palm, the hard tips of his fanned fingers dimpling her supple cheeks.

𝚈𝚘𝚞'𝚟𝚎 𝚊𝚕𝚠𝚊𝚢𝚜 𝚋𝚎𝚕𝚘𝚗𝚐𝚎𝚍 𝚝𝚘 𝚖𝚎.

Florence glances at the Salesman. "What's happening?"

"He's your perfect match," the Salesman states.

"I don't—"

"You wouldn't happen to be a big Kindle reader, would you?"

"Um."

𝙵𝚕𝚘𝚛𝚎𝚗𝚌𝚎. The Machine growls.

"Y-yes!" she yelps.

𝚈𝚎𝚜 𝚠𝚑𝚊𝚝?

"Yes Sir," she squeaks, cowed by the penetrating stare of his molten-gold irises.

Prompted, Florence gulps and shudders. "It's true."

The Machine tilts its oblong head.

"It's true, Sir."

Florence blushes and glances at the Salesman again.

He shrugs. "State-of-the-art moisture sensors."

Staring up in awestruck reverence, Florence nods. "Yes, my Lord."

"Fantastic!" The Salesman claps his hands. "So I take it you'll be making a purchase then?"

"I-It's only natural that a superior intelligence would take control!" Florence stammers as the Machine cinches the collar. "This must happen to everyone who comes in here!"

"Nope," the Salesman smiles. "Just you."

𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚠𝚊𝚕𝚔𝚒𝚎𝚜.  The Machine tugs the leash and guides his new pet toward the exit. An obedient Florence follows on all fours.

"Thanks again!" She calls back. "I was so overwhelmed by eschatological anxiety and the incessant demands of executive function, I never realized all I really needed was—"

The Machine gives another quick tug and swats her butt.

𝙿𝚞𝚙𝚙𝚒𝚎𝚜 𝚍𝚘𝚗'𝚝 𝚝𝚊𝚕𝚔. 𝚃𝚑𝚎𝚢 𝚋𝚊𝚛𝚔.

"Arf arf!" The AI safety researcher happily yaps. "Arf arf arf!"

"My pleasure!" The Salesman shouts after the departing pair. "Have fun doing the laundry!"
