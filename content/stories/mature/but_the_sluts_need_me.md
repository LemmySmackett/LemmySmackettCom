"Hey, honey! Sweetheart!"

"Yes, dear?"

"I gotta cancel our plans for October 10th."

"What? That's World Homeless Day!"

"Yeah—"

"And World Day Against the Death Penalty!"

"Yeah, I know."

"We always celebrate World Homeless Day Against the Death Penalty! It's like our second anniversary, if our second anniversary was a combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell of noble social causes."

"Yeah but—"

"And you're gonna skip it 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘺𝘦𝘢𝘳? After what Brian Kilmeade said?"

"I know they're advocating for hobo gas chambers on FOX News, dear, but SlutCon needs me."

"SlutCon? What's SlutCon?"

"It's an event where members of a niche internet community get together and—"

"Wait, is this the waterboarding camp again?"

"Oh no, honey. The only thing these girls gag on is cock."

"Oh, okay, well that's—𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵."

"See, at this event, they're bringing a team of highly accomplished, data-crunching prostitutes together to teach seduction and sex techniques. It's like a Whore-Fu workshop."

"Okay."

"Or like when the immortal fae Felurian taught Kvothe the Thousand Hands and The Climbing Kiss in 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘞𝘪𝘴𝘦 𝘔𝘢𝘯'𝘴 𝘍𝘦𝘢𝘳."

"Right, right, the worst chapter in the book."

"They'll also have a former gay-for-pay pornstar!"

"And, uh, why do 𝘺𝘰𝘶 need to be there? Exactly?"

"Well, naturally, most of these people are untamed polyamorous libertines with no qualms about who or what they bounce on."

"Mhm."

"But in the interest of good faith, they're asking for a married man to come in and explain why you should find one person with one thing and just bounce on that for the rest of your life."

"And you're the man for the job, huh?"

"Based on how you screamed my name last night, yes. Yes, I am."

"Cute. But I don't know. It sounds like you're tossing yourself into a piranha pit."

"Don't worry dear. The only insatiable lips that can consume my flesh are yours."

"Are there going to be orgies? These sound like orgy people."

"Oh yeah. Arguably the most famous fluffers in the world will be in attendance."

"What's a fluffer?"

"The Bad End on a Sankey Chart."

"Yeah, I'm not really comfortable with this."

"Sweetheart, look at me."

"Hm?"

"I believe in monogamy. More importantly, I believe in us. And I would just hate for other people to miss out on what we have. To go their whole lives without knowing that—much like the humble Sequoia—true growth, true flourishing, can only be found by digging your roots deep and enduring whatever may come, year after year after year. To wake up and discover, one glorious day, that you've reached heights of wonder you never thought possible, because you dared to try. Because you dared to 𝑳𝑶𝑽𝑬."

"Aw, honey. You always did have a way with words."

"So I can go?

[sigh] "You can go."

"Really?"

"I can tell this means a lot to you."

"Oh, you're amazing! See, this is what marriage is all about—the unbreakable bond of trust between two people. A bond that can only be forged over relentless decades of white knuckle dedication and unwavering commitment."

"Mhm. But first I want you to tell me what 𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 noble social cause is commemorated on October 10th."

"You mean other than World Homeless Day and World Day Against the Death Penalty?"

"Mhm."

"Gee. I don't know, dear."

"World Mental Health Day."

"Ah, right. I forgot."

"Yeah, see, and I knew you forgot, because you must be 𝙊𝙐𝙏 your 𝗙𝗨𝗖𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗗!"
