"Oh my God, Tiffany~~ It's been so long!" Outside a chic downtown café, two women in their late twenties—a blonde and a brunette—embrace.
"I haven't seen you since high school!"

"I know! I know! Oh Wendy, where does the time go?"

𝙒𝙖𝙖𝙖𝙪𝙪𝙜𝙝!

"Uh, Tiffany?"

"Hm?"

"Did your Lululemon duffel bag just cry?"

Tiffany waves her off. "Oh, it does that all the time."

"Uh."

"Here, let me get it out."

"Get what out?"

𝙒𝙖𝙖𝙖𝙪𝙪𝙜𝙝 𝙒𝙖𝙪𝙜𝙝 𝙒𝙖𝙪𝙜𝙝!

"Ta Dah!"

"Oh wow, it's a—Tiffany! I didn't know you were a—"

"It's a Labubu!" 

"A la-what?"

"You know those cute fuzzy monster plush toys that are all the rage?"

"Uuuh."

"I've been going crazy collecting them, but this is my crown jewel!" The blonde holds the screaming infant aloft.

"Tiffany, that's a baby."

"It's naked right now but the hair is supposed to grow in later—like a chia pet!"

"..."

"It's amazing right? Super rare, one of a kind—and so life-like!"

"Uh yeah, Tiffany, it's supposed to be life-like. It's a 𝘣𝘢𝘣𝘺."

"You're probably wondering where I got it."

"No, I'm pretty sure I know where you got it. I mean, I hope I'm sure—"

"So I saw a TikTok."

"Okay."

"And it said you can make your own custom one-of-a-kind Labubu—"

"Uh huh."

"—in your girl tummy—"

"..."

Tiffany leans in, lowering her voice to a whisper. "—but first you have to let a man put his thingie between your legs and wiggle it around a little."

"You don't say," Wendy deadpans.

"I thought it was crazy too! But I saw it on a TikTok so it must be true."

"Tiffany you can't believe everything you see on TikTok. I mean yeah that's how you make babies but—"

"I've learned so much though! It's how I bought my house!"

"Oh, you have a new house too?"

"Well no. For some reason the bank took it back." 

"Ah."

"They're accusing me of something called 'wire fraud'? I followed the 'Free House' guide step-for-step, so I'm sure it's all just a big misunderstanding."

"Tiffany, wire fraud is a felony."

"A felony? Like the flower?"

"What? No. A felony is a—"

"Or was it an herb?"

"No, it's a—"

"Never mind, I'll look it up later."

Wendy sighs. "...on TikTok?"

"Uh huh!"

"Okay. So who's the father?"

Tiffany tilts her head. "The what?"

"Whose, uh, thingie did you put between your legs to help make the..." Wendy glances at the blubbering baby. "You didn't name it Labubu, did you?"

"Oh, I don't really keep track of that."

"You don't keep track of the name or the father?"

"Either." Tiffany wiggles the infant. "Okay, that's enough for now. Activate Sleep Mode."

"Tiffany, the father of this baby owes you child support. You need all the help you can get, especially if you lost the house—"

"Really? That's great!" Tiffany grins. "In that case, there are lots of fathers."

"Uh."

"At least fifty!"

"Fifty?" Wendy furrows her brow. "Tiffany, how many people did you sleep with?"

"So the TikTok explained something called male-female microchimerism."

"..."

"And it said that if I harvest enough Labubu juice from as many men as possible, it increases my chances of creating a hyper-rare Labubu!"

"Jesus Christ," Wendy mutters.

"And it improves the TFR! Whatever that is. Naturally, I went out and got all the Labubu Juice I could take. You wouldn't believe how sore—"

𝙒𝙖𝙖𝙖𝙪𝙪𝙜𝙝 𝙒𝙖𝙪𝙜𝙝 𝙒𝙖𝙪𝙜𝙝!

"Jesus, Tiffany, your baby is 𝘩𝘶𝘯𝘨𝘳𝘺."

The blonde sighs. "Alright, alright. I try not to spoil him." 

"Spoil him?" Wendy scowls. "With 𝘧𝘰𝘰𝘥?"

From her duffle bag, the blonde pulls out an infant-sized bridle, mounts a pre-mixed formula bottle in it, and fastens the device to the child's head. "There! That should keep him quiet."

Content, the baby suckles on the plastic nipple. Wendy stares at the contraption.

"It's a Labubu Feeder!" Tiffany beams. "Guess where I got it from?"

"TikTok," Wendy numbly mumbles.

"How'd you know??" 

"Wild guess." Wendy slumps into a café chair. 

"You know, it's weird." The blonde presses a finger to her cheek. "A lot of those Labubu videos go on and on about the TFR, throwing all kinds of numbers around. What do you think the right TFR number is?"

Wendy glances up. "For you Tiffany?"

"Uh huh."

"Zero."
