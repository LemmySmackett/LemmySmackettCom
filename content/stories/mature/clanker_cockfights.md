"Bro, my weekend was sick. I placed third at the Clanker Cockfights!"

"..."

"You should've seen it, man. I was—hey. Yo!"

"...hm?"

"Can you hear me?"

"Not in English."

"What?"

"My AirPods auto-translate everything to Japanese the moment you walk in the room."

"Oh, nice. Saucing me up with a little bushido wasabi."

"No,I'm trying to block—"

"Subarashii shimapan shibari, my Wapanese o-niichan."

"Just talk."

"Check it out, third-place medal for the Clanker Cockfights!"

"That's a JPEG on your phone."

"Yeah, we're not an official organization yet, so I had Grok whip something up to commemorate the occasion."

"Congratulations."

"I've also got 1000 lewd generations of Ani Grok as a ring girl with huge knockers. See?"

"I assume Clanker Cockfight is a euphemism for Robo-Pokemon?"

"That it is."

"And much like Pokémon, you go around challenging other bot owners to 1-on-1 clanker combat?"

"Exactly, exactly. Everybody's got a bot nowadays—for protection, groceries, companionship, whatever—and most are willing to throw down if you wave a Benjamin in their face. What with us all being trapped in the permanent underclass and all."

"You realize you're part of a gang, right?"

"Hey! Just because we go around baiting people into fights for our own cruel amusement doesn't mean we're a gang! Though we do have a Pokémon-style gang leader."

"Yeah? What's his name?"

"Ash Flashem."

"Because he's wanted for indecent exposure in nine states?"

"Ten states. Bro, you're a terepashī today!"

[sigh] "Let's wrap this up. So you won third place at a convention center or something?"

"Nah, man. I won it at the corner of 6th and MLK."

"That's...an intersection."

"Uh huh."

"Downtown."

"Yeah, so we took over the whole street with some drag racers and they did donuts while the bots tossed fireballs at each other."

"Fireballs?"

"The bare-knuckle back-flipping bot combat was getting a little boring, so the Skibidi Rizz thing to do now is mod and attach your own 3D-printed flamethrower with a back-mounted blue rhino propane tank."

"I do love propane."

"It burns clean, brother."

"And how many people were there, exactly?"

"Oh, it had to be 100. Easy."

"So you're telling me 100 people shut down the busiest street in the city so you nutjobs could run an illegal robo-pokemon tournament with back-flipping, flame-throwing robots?"

"Hell yeah!"

"Lovely. Who won first and second?"

"Gary Grabbem and Mark Molestem."

"Sounds like a stand-up pair of guys."

"They are. Unfortunately, both got nabbed by the cops when their bots accidentally roasted a car full of bikini-clad eighteen-year-olds during the final showdown."

"Jesus."

"You think you know what the screams of four young blondes with their whole lives in front of them burning to death is going to sound like. But you don't."

"So I guess that makes you first place by elimination, huh?"

"Hey. I guess it does!"

"I'm going to put my headphones back on now, and I'm going to pretend like you haven't spent the last five minutes incriminating yourself in a quadruple homicide."

"Arigatō gozaimasu, o-niichan!"
