Young lovers sit at the end of a long wooden pier, the waves of the Pacific gently lapping at the algae-stained concrete pilings below. As the sky melts into hazy streaks of pink and purple, Theo glances at the woman beside him—the earthbound angel more resplendent than any sunset.

"Blair," he says, caressing her pale cheek. "There's nothing I wouldn't give to end a thousand days—no, ten thousand days—just looking at you."

The windswept brunette leans into his broad palm and catches his tender, loving eye. "Kiss bait," she whispers.

"Kiss bait?" He scoffs. "How's that kiss bait?"

She shrugs. "Kiss bait."

"I'm saying I want to spend a decade or two with you, and you're gonna accuse me of—"

"Proposal bait."

"Proposal bait??" He balks. "Now hold on. I'm not saying you wouldn't be a great mother or anything, but let's not get ahead of ourselves—"

"Impregnation bait."

"Oh, Impregnation bait?" He smirks and reaches around, copping a feel beneath her pleated skirt. "With an ass like this, can you blame a fella for trying?"

"Sunset Peer-side Backshots bait," she replies.

"Alright, look," he sighs. "You can't call 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 bait. It doesn't—"

"Appeal to Reason bait."

"You're just gonna keep going, huh? No shame?"

"Appeal to Respectability bait."

Theo purses his lips. "Blair, I've been trying to hold off on telling you this, but I think you're spending a little too much time online."

"Petition for Sensible Digital Consumption Habits bait."

"Christ. Look, it was funny for the first week, and kinda looped back around on the third, but it's been a month now, and—"

"Worn Out Bit bait."

"Blair. You have to stop. Please. Half of these don't even make sense."

"Request for Coherence bait.

"Stop it! Seriously! When I got pulled over for speeding the other day, you almost got us arrested with this shit."

"Jail bait."

"That's not jail bait!"

"Semetics bait."

"It's semantics, not semetics. Semetics is—"

"Jew bait."

"That's hummus! I mean—"

"Truth nuke.

"Augh! That's it!" Theo bolts up. "No more! If you're not casting a line for yellowfin croaker—" He points toward the sea. "—out in those goddamn waves, I don't want to hear one more word about bait, or I swear to fucking God, I'll—"

"Break Up B—"

"Don't." He hisses, eyes wild and wide. "You finish that line and we're 𝘥𝘰𝘯𝘦."

She stares up at him, impassive.

"This entire month has been one long Family Guy reject sketch of a nightmare, and my mother now thinks you're an absolute brain-rot crackpot. Give me one good reason— just one—why I shouldn't march down this peer and leave your psychotic Twitter-addled ass right now."

Blair continues to stare.

"Well?" 

The brunette casually reaches under her blouse, unclasps her bra, and flashes her ample rack.

Theo glances between her blank expression and her perky bug bite nipples. "Motoboat bait?" 

She nods.

He kneels and plants his nose in her cleavage with a defeated sigh. "Motorboat bait."
