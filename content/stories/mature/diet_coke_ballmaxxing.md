"Damn, dude. It's not even 10 AM and you're already on your 3rd Diet Coke."

"5th."

"The fuh?"

"I pre-gamed in the shower. And on the way into work."

"Pre-game? What are you pre-gaming?"

"I'm Ballmaxxing bro."

"...why can't you ever have a normal hobby? Like amateur taxidermy? Or competitive pig flipping?"

"Research shows that ingesting a high dose of Coca-Cola increases testosterone production and promotes testis growth."

"Okay."

"Logic then dictates that constant Coke ingestion leads to constant, hyperbolic ball growth‚Äî"

"Logic does ùòØùò∞ùòµ dictate that, actually."

"‚Äîlike AGI."

"Logic is a prisoner you keep bound and gagged in the caliginous basement you call a prefrontal cortex."

"Heh. Bound and gagged."

"What?"

"Like your ex-girlfriend."

"She was kinky."

"I never knew someone could love rope so much."

"Yeah...God I miss her."

"She wouldn't have left if you drank Diet Coke."

"Eh?"

"No woman can say no to big carbonated balls."

"And just why would having big carbonated balls help me keep an insatiable ropebunny slut who cheated on me with a Guatemalan busboy in the back of a Red Lobster walk-in freezer?"

"Brother, are you familiar with the Bible?"

"Am I familiar with the most popular book in the world?

"Uh huh."

"A book that's sold more than 6 billion copies and been translated into over 3000 languages?"

"Uh huh."

"I have some passing familiarity with it, yes."

"Ezekiel 23: 20."

"Am I supposed to know that verse off the top of my head? Cuz I got half of John 3: 16, at best."

"There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses."

"Uh."

"You wanna keep your lovers from being swiped by Guatemalan Red Lobster busboys, you gotta have those donkey-ball horse emissions, bro."

"I don't think that's‚Äî"

"It's a proverb."

"It's a string of words you could decontextualize and restructure your whole life around, sure."

"That's what's beautiful about the Bible, bro."

"Uh."

"It's full of God-breathed ageless wisdom."

"Just to be clear, you think God is encouraging you through 2,000 year old scripture to drink 10 cans of Diet Coke before noon so you can grow bigger balls and bust like a bronco."

"The LORD works in mysterious ways."

"You do know they didn't have Coke in the Bible, right? Let alone Diet Coke?"

"Of course not."

"Ok."

"The syrup in regular Coca-Cola wasn't invented until 1886 by the ex-Confederate pharmacist, John Stith Pemberton. And Diet Coke didn't launch until 1982."

"Ok good."

"During the time of Ezekiel, the Judeans all drank Topo Chico."
