"So I guess Elon's America Party is dead huh? Since he spends all his time generating AI coomer clips with twisted spine spasms straight out of the Exorcist?"

"Nope, the official America Party account released new memes on X today. They even had a banger with 3k likes!"

"There's more to being a political party than shitposting and bangers. I mean, there used to be more..."

"All the memes are made with Grok too. Check it out!"

"Oh, they redid the annoyed eagle logo."

"Uh huh."

"Why does it have a dump truck ass?"

"Elon finally realized Gooners are the great untapped demographic in American politics."

"Of course they're untapped—they're 𝘎𝘰𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘳𝘴."

"The America Party is gearing up for the midterms next year, so a lot of these memes feature patriotic iconography and a slogan encouraging people to get out and vote. See?"

"𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗩𝗼𝘁𝗲."

"Uh huh."

"Well nobody's ever accused Mr. Musk of subtlety."

"Here's another one."

"𝗘𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝗘𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘆."

"Great right?"

"Actually, I'd prefer to know the people in the voting line with me are 𝘯𝘰𝘵 on the cusp of denial-play-induced orgasmic release."

"Speaking of releases..."

"𝗕𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 (𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘁) 𝗕𝗼𝘅."

"Inspiring right?"

"Yeah, it's going to inspire a lot of biohazard PPE and hazmat purchases by poll workers."

"See, the America Party is already bolstering the GDP. Here's the last one."

"𝗗𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘄𝗮𝗺𝗽 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘀."

"Honestly, I think this one's a bit much."

"Well, at least there's a limit. Should I even ask why the America Party Eagle is flashing her panty-covered cloaca at me in every picture?"

"She's spread eagle."

"Right, of course. Last question: why is the Statue of Liberty also in every picture, why is she so short, and why does she have a giant green rack?"

"It's called Oppai Loli and it represents 𝑭𝑹𝑬𝑬𝑫𝑶𝑴."
