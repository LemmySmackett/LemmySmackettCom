"Oh, Samuel. What a wonderful first date~♥️ I never knew pig flipping could be so fun. Or so competitive!"

"I'm tellin' you, Becky, it's going mainstream. The American Pig Flip League keeps growing and growing, year after year."

"Wow."

"We're bigger than the NHL now."

"I believe it."

"This winter, I'm gonna finally take the Golden Trough from my life-long rival, Jebediah "Big Boar" Jones, at the L.A. Crypto dot Com arena."

"Oh, I just know you'll win!"

"I will. But right now there's only one naughty sow I wanna flip and pin in a filth-ridden mud-slop sty, and I'm looking right at her."

"Samuel, that's deeply offensive. And more than a little misogynistic."

"Yeah."

"De-humanizing, really."

"Mhm."

"But I'm so into you that it's actually turning me on!"

"I know."

"Gosh, I've never felt this way before. Why, if you told me to put on a plastic pig snout with a cheap elastic band, I think I just might!"

"Well, you're in luck, little gilt. I always keep a Temu snout in my back pocket."

"Oh."

"For just such an occasion."

"How conscientious!"

"Heh."

"I love a man who plans ahead....Okay, how do I look?"

"Like you spend every waking moment of your short miserable life stuffed in a 2 x 7 ft gestation crate."

"I bet you say that to all the girls~♥️"

"I do."

[giggle]

"Now let's bring you into my apartment and get you squealing proper."

"Breed me gently, you savage bea—Oh."

"Hm?"

"Who's that?"

"Who's what?"

"There! In the corner beside the trophy case!"

"Oh, her?"

"Yes, 𝘩𝘦𝘳."

"That's my EVA-9."

𝙷𝚎𝚕𝚕𝚘.

"I didn't know you had a roommate..."

"She's not my—"

"A 𝘣𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘦, 𝘧𝘦𝘮𝘢𝘭𝘦 roommate."

"No, she—"

"Wait. Is this a ménage à trois play?"

"What? No."

"'Cause you're gonna have to butter this bacon up a lot more if you're looking for some three-course Boston Butt action, mister."

"She's a machine!"

"...oh. Really?"

"Yep. A stunningly beautiful, life-like android companion engineered to master my daily routines, engage in witty, heartfelt conversations, and dynamically adapt to my emotional state, evolving with every interaction to be the perfect partner."

".....oh."

"But Becky, you just said we had a great date!"

"Samuel."

"What happened?"

"Listen."

"I'm listening.

"We did have a great date—a date so amazing, so mind-blowingly fantastic, that I was willing to suspend all my deeply held beliefs and self-respect as a modern woman just to subject myself to your deranged pig fetish."

"I'm on board so far."

"But that was before I met your freakazoid goonbot slave-wife."

"Freakazoid goonbot slave-wife?"

"Any girl would wither up like sun-dried jerky after that."

"EVA, not now. Becky, she's not my freakazoid goonbot slave-wife."

"Uh huh."

"The EVA-9 simply shatters isolation while offering rock-solid companionship and emotional anchors. The engineers who built her said she's not even 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘨𝘯𝘦𝘥 to rival genuine human romance."

"Right, okay. She's not designed to be my competition."

"She's not!"

"She's just the perfect woman, hyper-customized to your every preference, penchant, and kink, hidden away and out of sight in your home, where neither the neighbors nor God can judge you."

"Exactly."

"With platinum blonde hair, pillow-soft lips, and size G hooters."

"Am I supposed to go smaller?"

"Nope. Leaving now."

"Oh okay. I see what this is. You're a biochauvinist."

"What?"

"A clankerphobe."

"I'm not a clankerphobe!"

"You're clearly a clankerphobe."

"That's not even the proper nomenclature!"

"You can keep the damn snout!"

"And now we're throwing things."

"You want some porcine-themed copulation so bad, why don't you put that cheap dollar store nose on your cheap blonde bimbobot and oink off!"

"Actually, I took out an $18,000 Klarna loan to buy EVA."

"Holy shit."

"And I'm not gonna lie: I tried the pig snout thing and the degradation just doesn't hit the same if it's not a real woman."

"UGH!"
