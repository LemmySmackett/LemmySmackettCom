The nubile blonde bites her lip and shakes her head.

"1,902 dollars. And 52 cents. Give or take." He leans in and cups her dainty chin with his curled index finger. Her breath hitches as his icy blue eyes penetrate her soul. "You know how long I just ripped that silent crop duster for?"

Her brow knits. "What crop dus-" Her lips pucker, her nose wrinklesâ€”the acrid stench guts her nostrils like a derrick boring the earth.

He cants his head. "Hm?"

"Six seconds. That was a $190 fart." He smirks as he rips another. A frog croaks to death in his bespoke Italian trousers. "And there's more where that came from."
