So Johnny, I hear you're attempting to conceive."

"Uh, hi, Dad. And yes, Vanessa and I are trying for our first child."

"Kino."

"I always feel weird telling people that."

"Why? It's what newlyweds do."

"Sure, but it feels like I'm grabbing a megaphone and screaming, 'Hey world, I'm going RAW in my wife!'"

"Mhm."

"Monday Night WWE style."

"Oh. You're only doing it on Mondays?"

"What?"

"That's six prime seed plantin' days left off the table."

"No, it's a—"

"A table she should really be on. Back flat, legs up."

"Hey, I don't think that's—"

"I guess you guys aren't serious."

"Hey! Vanessa's on that table, back flat, legs up, ready to get seeded Sunday to—"

"Hm?"

"Ahem. On second thought, I'm not comfortable sharing my marital insemination schedule with my father."

"That's fine. Actually, now that you're making the attempt, it's time I handed something down to you. Something your grandfather gave to me."

"Oh. We have a patrilineal family heirloom?"

"We have a patrilineal family heirloom."

"Wow. I didn't think we could afford that."

"Normally, we couldn't. But your great-grandfather was a frugal son of a bitch, and he always had an eye for deals. So here you go."

"...uh, dad?"

"Yes son."

"This is a dress."

"That's right."

"A yellow polka dot sun dress."

"Yep.  From SHEIN."

"And you got this from your dad?"

"And his father before him."

"...are we a family of patrilineal transvestites?"

"What?"

'Cause I'm not putting this on."

"It's not for you! It's for Vanessa!" 

"Oh. Okay. It's soft. What is this, rayon?"

"That's the sundress I railed your mother in when 𝘺𝘰𝘶 were conceived."

"EUGH!"

"Hey! Don't drop it! This is the family heirloom!"

"Dad, I don't want the dress you banged mom in!"

"Son, every dress your mother owns is the dress I banged her in." 

"God."

"Even that kaftan maxi with the Moroccan print. You know, the one that hugs her fat ass?"

"Non-consensual evocative imagery!"

"The point is, every man in this family was conceived by a woman wearing this dress."

"...no."

"Yes."

"You're saying mom, grandma, and great grandma all got railed and impregnated in 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 exact dress."

"That's right, son. And now I pass it on to you, to impregnate your own cherished wife, in a public park or back alley, siring the next generation of our proud and noble lineage."

"Dad, I don't think Vanessa is going to want an old, crumpled SHEIN dress that was worn by her matrilineal in-laws while they were getting porked by the patriarchs."

"She won't. And that's why you're going to lie to her."

"Lie to her? Dad, I'm not gonna lie to my new wife."

"Son, I've been in this game a long time, and believe me when I tell you that a firm marriage is built on a healthy foundation of little white lies."

"Eh."

"And sometimes, very big lies."

"Eeeh."

"Besides, this is our tradition. Your heritage. If you break the chain, this treasured dharma, who knows what evil Vishnu will visit upon our heads."

"Dad, we're Christian."

"Well, even so. I'll get pissed and cut you out of the Will."

"What? Really?"

"Your brother Daryl will get the double wide 𝘢𝘯𝘥 the Ford Focus."

[sigh] "Fine. I'll do it."

"Kino, son. Very kino."

"Have you washed it at least?"

"Son, are you familiar with the Restoration of the Sistine Chapel?"

"The answer's no', isn't it?"

"Over the course of two decades, a team of highly-skilled restorationists led by Gianluigi Colalucci used distilled water, gelatinous solvents, and dimethylformamide solutions to wash away layers of residue that had accumulated over the centuries."

"Dad, really. You can just say 'no'."

"When they finished, Michelangelo's frescoes shone brighter than ever before. Some even described them as blinding, almost neon. And yet, people were outraged. Do you know why?"

[sigh] "Why Dad?"

"Because they weren't just washing away layers and layers of grime, soot, and candle smoke filth, son. They were washing away something more. Something completely irreplaceable."

"And what's that, dad?"

"History."
