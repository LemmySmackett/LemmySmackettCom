"I'M A NAZI" ye said.

"Prove it pussy," said LindyMan Paul Skallas. "Put a swastika on all your clothes."

And ye put a swastika on all his clothes.

"I TOLD YALL BITCHES IM A REAL ASS NAZI," ye said.

"Prove it pussy," said Paul Skallas. "Legally change your name to YAYDOLF YITLER."

And ye legally changed his name to YAYDOLF YITLER.

"IMMA SPEAK MY TRUTH  HITLER WAS FRESH  THE THIRD REICH WAS TIGHT  BUT IM THE GREATEST NAZI THERE EVER WAS   THE GREATEST RAPPER THERE EVER WAS  AINT NOBODY DONE IT LIKE ME  IM GOD IN THIS BITCH," YAYDOLF YITLER said.

"Prove it pussy," said Paul Skallas. "Immanentize the eschaton. Bring forth the Fourth Reich."

And YAYDOLF YITLER did. In 2028, YAYDOLF YITLER created the YHWH party (YAYDOLF'S HOLY WORLD HIERARCHY), ran for president, and won. With the help of the YITLERITES elected to the House and Senate, he abolished the government of the United States of America—ending a 252 year old empire. From its ashes rose YEZREAL (it didn't quite fit with the whole YITLER thing, but he liked how it sounded). In YAYDOLF's YEZREAL, every white T-shirt cost $240 and shoes were ugly as fuck. By law. In the major cities across this great nation, YITLER ordered every outdoor warning system, every government PA—anything with a loudspeaker—to blast Black Skinhead on an endless loop. Where loudspeakers could not be found, he ordered the military to deploy LRADs.

"YALL TALK THAT SHIT FOR YEARS," YAYDOLF YITLER said. "NOW YOU'LL HEAR IT FOR YEARS."

Paul Skallas was rounded up with the whites and the Jews, along with everyone who ever doubted YAYDOLF, and led to the YHWH branded gas chambers. He had to pay $560 to get in.

As Paul Skallas stepped to the gas chamber door, YAYDOLF YITLER ran up.

"Wait, wait," YAYDOLF said. "I gotta ask your honkey ass something."

Paul Skallas turned. "Yes?"

YAYDOLF gave him a vulnerable look. "You think I'm ever gonna top Graduation?"

"Anxiety over our past achievements." Paul smiled. "Very Lindy." Ω
