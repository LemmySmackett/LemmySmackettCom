Hey man, I just finished that game you recommended."

"Oh? Which one?"

"Last Shift at the Shell Station: the Sensitive Young Man Simulator."

"Ah, yeah. Love that game. What an experience, huh?"

"Naw dude, I 𝘩𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘥 it."

"Ha. You got stuck on the Title IX underwater escort mission, didn't you?"

"Man—"

"Everyone gets stuck on the Title IX underwater escort mission."

"—I got stuck on every mission. I've never played anything so tedious and poorly designed in my life: the controls suck, the graphics suck, the story's batshit insane with some of the most obscene and disturbing content this side of Shoujo Tsubaki—"

"Haha, yeah."

"—and to top it all off, the music sounds like Brian Eno went into an epileptic seizure while slapping his dick on a 3-key Yamaha synthesizer."

"The music is an acquired taste."

"Yeah, you know what else is an acquired taste? Antifreeze."

"Well, hey. Now you can join the Last Shift at the Shell Station online community."

"Online community?"

"Yep, we call ourselves Sensitive Shifties. Or Shits, for short."

"Jesus, there are fans of this Go Nagai ass nightmare?"

"Uh huh. A huge following on Twitter and r/Sensitive_Shifty is 2 million members strong."

"2 𝘮𝘪𝘭𝘭𝘪𝘰𝘯?"

"And let me tell you right now that every self-proclaimed shifty is the greatest human being I've ever had the honor of knowing."

"Uh, sorry, I don't associate 'great human being' with 'guy who willingly sits through two uninterrupted hours of quick time event child cannibalism cutscenes.'"

"To be fair, you have to kill all of the Hispanic day laborers and intentionally get in the German Realtor's Winnebago on three consecutive Wednesdays to go down the Child Cannibalism route—"

"Sure but—"

"—and Fluoride Jones the Eunuch Hobo Oracle makes it very clear what will happen if you do."

"Right but—"

"Not everybody plays all the routes. You press the buttons, brother."

"Oh miss me with the moral finger-wagging, Toby Fox. If I buy a game, I'm getting my money's worth."

"You bought it during the Steam sale, right? It's usually like 6 bucks."

"Sure, and when it's my hard-earned 6 dollars, there's no limit to the number of screaming kidnapped Korean nine-year-olds I'll devour face-first to get my money's worth."

"Well—"

"I'm a completionist."

"As long as you had your fill."

"I can't even imagine what a subreddit for this game looks like. Probably a full-blown glowie convention for the FBI Mindhunter unit."

"Oh, it's just the usual fandom stuff really. Fanart, AUs, plot theories."

"Uh huh."

"Mostly it's rule34 of Lashonda the Manager."

"Well, I can't blame anyone for that. The jiggle physics on her ass were mesmerizing."

"Fun fact: that's the only part in the whole game that uses live action mocap."

"Really?"

"Really."

"No cap on the mocap ass clap?"

"No cap. Many fans feel that the 'Blackmailed Stripper' route is the highlight of not just the game, but the entire medium of ludonarrative itself."

"I'll admit: when them oiled-up mocha creme-cake buns started slapping together in triumphant x0.25 slow-mo right after she shanked Crack King Cassius? I was in tears, man."

"See?"

"I think I saw God."

"It's an experience."

"Okay, but the mandatory 900-hour minigame grind still sucks. If I ever see another sperm clinic, it'll be too soon."

"The game has its flaws, I'll admit. But for me, it's really all about the Shifty community. They're friendly, they're supportive, they're—"

"A bunch of depraved perverts on multiple government watchlists?"

"Maybe. But they'd also give you the shirt off their back. And their pants."

"Not beating the depraved pervert accusations."

"All across the world, Shifties work at soup kitchens and abuse shelters, build homes for the poor and wheelchair ramps for the disabled, run donation drives for blood and send malaria nets to Africa."

"Wow."

"And the Shifties are always there for each other. Hell, I've never told anyone this before, but all of the best men at my wedding were Shifties."

"No shit?"

"All Shit. And that was the first time I met any of them in person!"

"Huh. So that sounds nice and all, but uh you know you're just describing a church, right?"

"I got married at a Buffalo Wild Wings, actually."

"No, I mean, this community stuff you keep going on about: supporting each other, donating, volunteering—"

"Uh huh."

"That's a church. You guys can do all of that at a church without being fans of some weird, fucked-up fetish game with unhinged extremist politics."

"Well, sure, but who goes to church?"

"Touché."

"In the Sensitive Shifty community, we joke that the game acts as a kind of filter that keeps normies and social parasites out. Honestly, my life would be totally different without these people."

'Yeah?"

"Yeah. I might not even be alive."

"That's kinda cool, man. Weird, but cool."

"It is."

"I'm happy for you. Still can't believe 2 million people played the damn thing, let alone finished it."

"Oh, nobody ever finishes it."

"Say what."

"I mean, a few people here and there, but they're total outliers." 

"..."

"In fact, we call them Total Shitheads. People who can get through the whole game are kinda feared, really. Most of us play for about thirty or so minutes, like half of the first level."

"Half of the first level? That's just the tutorial where you work the register."

"Yeah, most people call it there."

"What? Nothing happens in the first thirty minutes! Or even the first three hours!"

"Right yeah. Everyone in the community knows you're not actually supposed to play the game, let alone to the end."

"Are you deadass for real right now?"

"Last I checked."

"Good, 'cause Imma 'bout to beat your ass real hard."

"What? Why?"

"Don't 'what why' me, you prick. Why the hell did you tell me to play the game  if nobody plays it?"

"Wha—because I wanted you to be a part of the community!"

"By tricking me into playing some drug-fueled revanchist ero-guro atrocity that's banned in over 200 countries?"

"I didn't trick you! I figured you'd give up and quit like a normal person!"

"Give up and—how much did you play it?!"

"How much did I play the game?"

"Yes, the game, you twat!"

"Oh, I've never played it at all."

"..."

"When I first joined the community, I watched a 3-minute cutscene compilation on YouTube."
