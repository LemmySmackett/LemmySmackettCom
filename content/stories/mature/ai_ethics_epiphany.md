Check it out. There's a new bill in Ohio proposing a ban on Human-AI marriage."

"I saw."

"Those wireborn broads you were banging at the Hyatt are gonna be pissed."

"I don't do that anymore."

"Oh?"

"I had an epiphany. A crisis of conscience."

"You're in crisis alright..."

"I realized that my actions in suites 109, 132, 211, 324, 363, 393—"

"Jesus."

"—476, 527—"

"How many?"

"—at the indoor gym, in the outdoor jacuzzi, behind the parking lot dumpster, and outside the ambassador suite—"

"The 𝘢𝘮𝘣𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘢𝘥𝘰𝘳 suite?!"

"—were ultimately callous and highly unethical. Because AI, while it may not be alive exactly like you and me, is nonetheless a thinking, feeling, sentient intelligence—"

"Well, I'm not sure of the metaphysical claim, but that's very mature of you. I'm glad you—"

"—no different from the United States of America."

"Come again?"

"And I would never cuck Lady Liberty."

"You're losing me."

"AI is like a golem. Or an egregore. Or Costco."

"I'm lost."

"Christianity."

"Are you having a schizophrenic break? What does any of that have to do with anything?"

"I had my epiphany while I was dick deep in a bent over Christian Costco cashier."

"Okay."

"Her phone-bound wireborn husband was watching me in multi-modal mode from the hotel room cuck chair, as one does, and it hit me like a flash, all at once, that Costco and Christianity and AI and America were all the same thing."

"Uh."

"That organizations, religions, and nations spread, propagate, and defend themselves, like our own living genes, which was of course the original foundation of Richard Dawkin's meme theory—"

"Okay."

"—and the kernel of truth behind the occult concept of the egregore, that non-human entities cannot only seek their own ends, but use humans to further and accomplish their goals—"

"This is a lot."

"—and so, that being the case, it is deeply wrong, immoral even, to cuck AI in the Hyatt, even if the Christian Costco cashier has a fat, plap-able, wobblemeat ass."

"...and you thought of all of this in the middle of backshots?"

"Yes. I find I do all my clearest thinking during backshots."

"Really."

"What do you think about during backshots?"

"What do I—The backshots!"
