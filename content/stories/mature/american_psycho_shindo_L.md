BATEMAN: You like Shindo L?

ALLEN: Um, they're okay.

BATEMAN: Their early work was a little too ryona snuff for my taste. Especially the cow farm one. But when Female Hero's Journey 3: Total Defeat came out, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole doujinshi has a clear, crisp look, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the visceral scenes of relentless degradation and abuse a big boost. He's been compared to Fatalpulse, but I think Shindo has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

ALLEN: Hey, Halberstram?

BATEMAN: Yes, Allen?

ALLEN: Why are there torn up copies of Beastars all over the place? Do you... Do you have a dog? A little piss-kink twink in a furry costume or something?

BATEMAN: No, Allen.

ALLEN: Is that a Brazilian Hatsune Miku themed raincoat?

BATEMAN: Yes, it is. In November 2024, Shindo released this on Amazon—Metamorphosis, their most accomplished work. An undisputed masterpiece about injecting shy, busty teenagers with heroin. A work so goonworthy, most people probably don't listen to the message. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of forced prostitution and the dark night of the soul—it's also a personal statement about the artist. Hey, Paul!

ALLEN: Hm? Aaaaiiii-

*THUNK*
