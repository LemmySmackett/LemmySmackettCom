Bro, it's a Christmas miracle!"

"Yes, it's a holy eve of yuletide blessings, isn't it?"

"I'll say."

"2025 has been a challenging year of rapid and frankly frightening technological advancement, but as always, the holidays offer us an opportunity to step back and reflect on what truly matters."

"Yep, like Elon pushing a new AI Xitter update that triggers another mass exodus to Bluesky."

"Oh, for the magi and the manger—"

"Christmas came early!"

"Can't you forget about insipid internet horseshit for five minutes?"

"Nope. Some people watch NORAD track Santa; I watch authentic Japanese mangaka and NSFW goon merchants with 400k followers delete their entire portfolios and flee in despair."

"Well, whatever. I don't want to hear about social media, or AI, or anything else. On a night like this, we should turn our thoughts to that which dignifies and ennobles the human spirit—"

"Right, so the new X feature is this AI button called 'Edit image'—"

"—and you're just gonna tell me anyway."

"—and all the bitchy anti-AI artists are Big Mad because it appears in the lower right-hand corner of whatever they post—"

"Okay."

"—and there's literally no way to get rid of it."

"Huh. X just slaps the button right on there?"

"FlexTape style."

"I mean, that does seem a little invasive. It basically invites other users to tinker."

"Yeah. Like, imagine some pathetic weeb-ass wannabe '''artist''' slaving away for 38 hours on his precious OC donut waifu, only for some drive-by jagoff to give her the Violet Beauregarde blueberry inflation treatment in three seconds."

"Ghastly. But to be fair, you could already edit whatever you want with Grok."

"And other image generators, sure. But this streamlines the whole process. Like, you can strip off a male character's shirt, tattoo 'Heil Hitler' on his chest, and re-upload in three clicks."

"Obviously, you're exaggerating but—"

"No, you can really do that. I did it to Hideo Kojima."

"Say what?"

"It works on 𝘢𝘯𝘺 image."

"Wait, so it's a button that allows you to on-the-fly deface and/or falsify any image posted on the platform?"

"Yep."

"And then instantly repost it."

"I told you, bro. A Christmas miracle. A gift to all the trolls and slop-slingers."

"Man, forget about art. This is like a full-blown one-click asshole accelerator."

"Exactly."

"I've got visions of sugar-plum pricks dancing in my head."

"Yeah. Like imagine posting a picture of your sister and a hundred drive-by jagoffs reply with 'cover her face in thick, sticky milk' generations within the first five minutes."

"Uh."

"And before you ask: yes, I did that to Hideo Kojima."

"Okay. First off, you should apologize to Kojima."

"Mōshiwake gozaimasen, Kojima-san!"

"And secondly, I'd rather not imagine that at all. Thanks."

"Oh. Well in that case, don't open your stocking stuffer tomorrow."

"Man, what the f—"

"If it's any consolation, I splurged on the glossy photo printer paper."

"𝐸𝑢𝑔ℎ."

"You know, to heighten the effect."
