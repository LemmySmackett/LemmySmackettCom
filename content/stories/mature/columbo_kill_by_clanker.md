Neurostroke Magnate Rex Marlow (played by Gene Hackman): Now if you're quite done with this tedious line of questioning, detective, I have an engagement to keep. 

Columbo (played by Peter Falk): Oh? Got a fancy party to go to?

RM: As a matter of fact, I do.

C: I've never been much for parties.

RM: I'm going to the official unveiling of our new AI-powered sex-toy wire-head product.

C: Oh yeah? What's it called?

RM: The Brain Me, Blow Me.

C: Wow, that's something. Really something...

RM: Now if you'll excuse me—

C: Oh, just one more thing.

RM [agitated]: Detective.

C: It's just a minor detail. A quibble really. But I can't get it out of my head...

RM: What is it?!

C: Well, I remembered when we first met, you said you're a fan of the Atlanta Braves.

RM: Yes. Anyone can see the posters on the wall. Is being a sports fan a crime, Detective?

C: No, no. Of course not. I love sports. Never was much on the field, but I love 'em all the same.

RM: Good.

C: But on the day of your wife's murder, the Braves were in town. And you took your Optimus bot, the murder weapon, with you. To the game.

RM [stares at Columbo]: ...

C: You don't remember? I have video of it right here, from the stadium's closed-loop security cameras.

[Columbo reaches into his rumpled trenchcoat and pulls out his iPhone. He plays a video of Rex Marlow and his Optimus bot standing side-by-side in the Owner's Box.]

RM [adjusts his tie]: My wife was never a Braves fan. 

C: Hm.

RM: The Optimus bot was my companion. Plenty of people have robot companions.

C: They do, that's true. But what I found interesting is this part right here.

[On the video, the stadium crowd launches into a Native American war chant. Rex Marlow and his Optimus bot raise their right hands and repeat a famous chopping motion]

C: You taught your bot to Tomahawk, Mr. Marlow.

RM: ...so? It's not a crime to cheer at a game, is it??

C: No, no. Some might quibble over issues of cultural sensitivity, but it's not a crime.

RM: R-right.

C: But you know, it's the darndest thing. I had the boys down at the lab bring an Optimus bot in and teach it to Tomahawk chop. On command. The way you taught your bot how to chop on command.

RM: ...

C: And then, just for fun, we put a knife in the bot's hand. Do you know what we found, Mr. Marlow?

RM [glaring]: ...what?

C: We found that when an Optimus bot with a knife does a Tomahawk chop, it matches the 25 stab wounds your wife endured.

RM [shuddering with mounting rage]: ...

C: The exact length, width, and depth. Down to the centimeter.

RM: Why you—

C: Im afraid the Brain Me, Blow Me will have to wait, Mr. Marlowe. You're going to jail.
