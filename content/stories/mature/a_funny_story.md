This reminds me of a funny story. One time I was at Red Lobster with the boys, knocking back Cape Codders and Endless Shrimp, when my pal Roy started bragging about his girl being quote unquote Good-In-Bed.

I said, 'Roy, a woman is like an organ grinder monkey. Sure, it's nice to see them dolled up in the bright, brocade vest and jaunty little fez, performing tricks to the crowd's delight while their sinuous simian tails sway with the tantalizing rhythm of their tight Capuchin clappers-'"

Roy set his beer down. "Yeah, I'm gonna stop you there."

"So," a weathered voice rasped from the back of the dining room. "You think you know women and apes, do ya?"  Me and the boys turned to find a wrinkled geezer shrouded in the shadows under a flickering, burnt-out downlight.

"That's right," I said, squaring my shoulders. "I run the biggest Primate Appreciators Club in the Dallas/Fort Worth Area." I ran the ùëúùëõùëôùë¶ Primate Appreciators Club in the Dallas/Forth Worth Area, and my only member was a fugitive Carriberean refugee living under an assumed identity to escape the wrath of Haitian Warlord Jimmy "Barbecue" Ch√©rizier. But I wasn't going to tell him that. "You can find us on Meetup dot com."

(I had invited the boys plenty of times, but somehow they were always busy.)

The geezer stood up and shambled over, dragging his right leg. "If you knew the first thing about women, you'd know a woman in the throes of passion is no different than a chimpanzee hopped up on Xanax."

Roy furrowed his brow. "Wouldn't the Xanax make the chimpanzee less, uh, passionate?"

"You'd think that. But you'd be wrong!" The geezer lifted his leg and slammed it on the table, sending shrimp and cheddar bay biscuits flying in every direction. It was a carbon fiber prosthetic, one of those running blades you see on the Paralympics. "But Xanax has unpredictable side effects. It lowers the inhibitions. Give one to a chimp and it'll-"

"-tear your face off." I cut in. "And rip your hands off too. Happened to a woman back in 2009."

"Jesus," Roy said. 

"The chimp was named Travis."

The geezer sneered. Now that he was under proper lighting, I had the chance to size him up good. Truth told, I wasn't too keen on his little play here‚Äîencroaching on my turf. I was the Fun Monkey Facts guy in the group. It sickens me when people think they can read some old Wikipedia article and act like their Google search is as good as my expertise. (Especially when I'm the primary contributor to said Wikipedia article.)

In addition to the leg, the geezer had a ratty Mall Santa beard, and wore a Marlins ballcap paired with a Cheeseburger in Paradise T-shirt. 

"Jimmy Buffet, huh?" I said with a patronizing smile. "I've always been more of a Kenny Chesney guy."

"You would be," he quipped.

It took all my restraint not to shiv him with my plastic claw cracker right then and there, but I still needed to replace the one I lost at home, and I couldn't afford another run in with the Law. I had priors (unpaid parking tickets and some trumped up trespassing charges at the Dallas Zoo).

The geezer shoved a bandaged finger in Roy's face. "You haven't made love to a true woman 'til you've slept with a Siren of the Sea. I was deep in the mangroves‚Äîcatchin' horseshoe crabs so I could drain their blood and sell it to local university researchers on the cheap‚Äîwhen a terrible thunderstorm came rollin' through. I was ready to go down with the ship like any seaworthy Captain, when a tangle of tentacles gripped the side of my bay boat and hauled up the most beautiful specimen these weary old eyes have ever beheld‚Äîa half woman, half octopus, caecelian sea witch. As the storm tossed us around, bouncin' and lurchin' from wave to wave, she was tossin' me around, leavin' a hundred hickeys all over my leathered flesh with her greedy little suction cups. Then she opened that lamprey mouth of hers and boy, I've never been drained drier."

Roy screwed up his face in disgust. "I think you got drunk and fucked a squid."

"Summertime, bitch!" I shouted as I lunged at the distracted geezer and severed his carotid artery with the plastic claw cracker. Granted, quoting Mr. Chesney didn't totally totally make sense in context, but it felt like the right thing to do in the moment, which, if you think about it, is what being Good-In-Bed is all about. I guess. IDK. Most girls just lie there. 

Anyway, now I'm doing twenty to life for murder and I don't even get conjugal visits. It's no Margaritaville, I can tell you that.
