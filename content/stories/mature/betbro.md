Two men in their mid-thirties sit on stools at their favorite locally-owned regional-chain sports bar. The stocky one, Howard, slumps. "I can't believe it."

"Me either." Dylan, tall and thin as a rail, shakes his head and takes a swig of his Pabst Blue Ribbon. "Packers are getting reamed out here."

"What?"

Dylan tilts his head to the 55" flatscreen mounted high on their left. "I got 20 bucks on that game. And that one." He nods to a different TV. And then another. "And that one. And—"

"Man, I don't care about the Packers." Howard waves him off. "My wife is cheating on me."

Dylan eyes the screens and takes another swig. "Lotta reaming going 'round." 

"We're getting a divorce!" Howard yelps before burying his face in his hands. A few patrons glance and look away. He mumbles on: "Jesus, help me, we're getting a divorce."

Dylan shrugs. "Well, you know, life isn't all sunshine and matrimonial bliss."

"What?" Howard lifts his head. "Yes, it is."

"Think so?"

"Uh, yeah. That's why it's called a life-long vow? 'Til death do us part?"

"See, now there's a bet I'd never take." Dylan clicks his tongue. "With a time horizon that long, you've got a massive exposure window and little means to mitigate risk."

Howard sighs. "Normally I'd tell you to shove the WallStreetBets-speak up your ass but—"

Dylan grins. "You know I'm right."

"And since you're right, my marriage is disintegrating. Congratulations."

"Ah well. You know what I do when I'm feelin' down?" Dylan throws his arm around Howard's slumped shoulders.

"Give terrible unsolicited life advice?"

"Nah. I just make a little wager."

"Man, get out of here!" Howard pushes Dylan away. "You're always making wagers."

"And I'm always feeling down. Hey! You wanna make a bet that if we make a bet right now, I'll feel better?" Dylan holds up his phone. "I got my BetBro ready to go."

"God, you and that damn gambling app."

"Uh, excuse me. It's an interpersonal prediction market platform, okay?"

"No, it's just an enabler for  incessant degenerate gambling. And on dumb shit too. You can't spend your life betting on everything."

"Come on, bro. I don't bet on everything."

"Oh? You tried to make 30 bets with me on the way here."

"So?"

"It's a 5-minute drive. That's a new bet every 10 seconds!"

"Hey, if it's wrong to bet a crisp five on 'Will we drive by a strung-out, possibly dead, homeless guy lying in the gutter' every time I'm riding in your car, I don't want to be right."

"Seriously, man. I can't remember the last time that damn app wasn't running your life. High school, maybe?"

"Yeah, it wasn't out then. Real shame too."

"Is it?"

"Course! We could have bet on losing our virginities—"

"Uh-huh."

"—and whether or not that Sharon Jones chick in Biology actually had a dick."

"Well, to settle that one, one of us would have had to look."

Dylan smirks. "I'd take one for the team."

Howard rolls his eyes. "I bet you would." Then he shakes his head. "Man, what are we even talking about? I'm getting a divorce!"

Dylan opens the BetBro app. "You wanna bet how much you'll lose in the settlement? Did you sign a pre-nup? Answer the second question first."

"Fuck you."

"No pre-nup then."

"I don't know where I went wrong like, hell, we never argued, money's good—"

"Was good," Dylan corrects.

Howard scowls. "I work some crazy hours now and then, but I'm just trying to support my family, you know? Be a solid provider, like my father was."

"Yeah, sometimes all it takes is one silver-tongued snake to ruin paradise. Garden of Eden type shit, I fear."

"And that's the other thing: Michelle's a Stay-at-Home mom. When did she even find time to meet this guy?"

"Bit of a mystery, ain't it? She, uh, tell you anything about him?"

"No. And it's weird 'cause she admitted the infidelity out of nowhere, but refuses to say anything else."

"Well..."

"She won't tell me the guy's name or anything about him. Like he's the one who needs to be protected."

"It's probably best not to know."

"I guess. Man, it's crazy."

"Eh?"

"You're just going through life—day in, day out, same old, same old—and then boom, calamity hits and it's all over."

Dylan nods. "It's hard to see change coming."

"But..." Howard pinches his brow as a memory percolates. "There was one thing."

"Oh?"

"A few months back, she started getting on me about taking risks."

"Risks?"

"Yeah. Out of nowhere, she started going on and on about how important it is to take risks. And mind you, this is from a woman who refuses to ride on a county fair Ferris wheel, let alone a rollercoaster."

"Well, statistically the rollercoaster is safer." Dylan takes a swig of his beer.

Howard goes on. "And she started coming to me with, like, stock market type shit. Look into this no-name biotech firm. Please buy a zero-DTE deep OTM on $NVDA for me."

Dylan nods. "God, I do love a good zero-DTE deep OTM."

"And again, this is from a girl who wouldn't know Vanguard from Van Halen! I just thought it was weird at the time, but maybe he was, I don't know—"

"Teaching her about the Iron Condor while she was Spread Eagle?"

"Again, fuck you."

"Listen, you gotta push all that shit out of your mind, alright?" Dylan turns to Howard. "If I've learned anything in life, you just gotta take your lumps, settle your bets, and move forward. And speaking of settling bets—"

"Pft! That's easy for you to say. My marriage isn't some 20-buck wager."

"Well, maybe if you treated it like one, things would be different."

"Excuse me?"

"I'm just saying: you gotta keep the risk alive to keep the love alive."

"Oh, here we go. Relationship advice from the perpetually single lotto-loving lothario.

"Personally, I like to start every date by betting a girl 20 bucks she'll be howling my name by the end of the night."

"Christ. I don't know how any woman puts up with—"

"It gives them a nice little pretext to put up some token resistance and act all aloof. There's nothing girls love more than putting up a fake little fight—"

"You."

"—and by the end of the night, I've got her screaming: "Oh God, Dylan! Take my money! Take my womb! Take it! Take it! Take it!"

More patrons look over this time, all puzzled by the strange rail-thin man hip thrusting the bar as he pantomimes an orgasm.

"It was you."

"Sometimes I stop the festivities and make the really feisty ones settle the bet right then and there. Course, I'd be better off taking the Under instead of the Over, all things considered, but—"

"You're the guy. You slept with my wife."

"And the last horse crosses the finish line. Which reminds me: Kentucky Derby this weekend. I got a fat stack on Lightcone Lightfoot."

"Why?"

"What do you mean 'why?' That horse has a 100-to-1 odds."

"No I mean—"

"I'll be a millionaire if Lightcone takes it. Well, I'd be a millionaire if it wasn't for the Fed's 37% top bracket marginal tax rate, but Ol' Uncle Sam—"

"No, you driveling home-wrecking degenerate!"

Any patron who wasn't already paying attention to the raucous pair by now jolts in their seat. A bartender motions to a concerned waitress and frantically points to the back of the restaurant. 

"Huh?"

"Why did you sleep with my wife?!"

"Oh, that."

The waitress runs to the back.

"Yes that, you, you, you—tinhorn ape!"

"Tinhorn ape?" Dylan looks around. "Are we in an old timey saloon?"

Somehow, he doesn't notice the sea of eyes staring back at him. Or perhaps he doesn't care.

"I loved Michelle! It would have been our 10-year anniversary this May!"

"I know that," Dylan says. "That's why I had to act."

"What?"

"Because of the bet."

"Bet? What fucking bet?!"

Dylan rapidly flicks his finger across his phone screen and holds it up. "9 years, 10 months, and 23 days ago, we made this bet."

The phone is open to the BetBro app. The screen reads:

𝗪𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗠𝗶𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗼𝗻 𝗛𝗼𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗯𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝟭𝟬-𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗿𝘆?

𝗪𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗺𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁: $𝟮𝟬

Howard stares in disbelief. He blinks.  "...what?"

"At your bachelor party, remember?"

"I-I don't..." Howards trails off, his throat coarse and dry. He gulps and croaks out in pain: "Bachelor party?"

"Hooters, yeah?" Dylan wiggles the phone. "You were going on and on about how happy you two were going to be together, eternally devoted, blah blah blah—completely failing to appreciate the ample thighs and breasts on display at that fine dining establishment, I might add—and after enduring your relentless, sickly-sweet prattle for over an hour, I offered a little wager and you gladly accepted."

"I did?" Unable to recall anything from that night, Howard's face spasms and contorts as a wave of conflicting emotions, each more wretched than the last, washes over him. "I-I mean, I never dreamed she would—"

"Which I thought was nuts because a bet like that is clearly susceptible to participant manipulation."

"Participant manipulation?"

"Of course! If she proved loyal over the years—which I was sure she wouldn't—as the guy taking the Over, I could easily win by forcing the outcome."

The world tilts as poor Howard goes pale. "...forcing the outcome?"

"Well, it was more of a gentle coaxing. You know how she is."

Unmoored from his surroundings, numbed by the surreal obscenity of his situation, Howard dumbly stares at Dylan as if he were some starflung, voidborn alien with viscuous grey skin and three eyes...

"I gotta admit though: my bet was based on false priors. I always took Michelle for the town bike type of girl. Turned out she was just a naive, wide-eyed romantic susceptible to sweet promises and tender half-truths."

...or maybe just an infernal scarlet demon with two jagged, spiraled horns.

"Honestly, I almost feel bad about it."

Howard's mouth fidgets as he finds his tongue. "You're psychotic. A full-blown sociopath."

"I mean, yeah, but that's true of all history's great gamblers. Ain't it?"

"You ruined our lives over that? Some dumbass bet from a decade ago?"

"Technically you ruined it by taking the Under. Now if you took the Over—"

"For twenty bucks?"

"Hey, twenty bucks is twenty bucks. And it wasn't a decade, that's very important to the settlement. It was 9 years, 10 months—"

"Dylan! We have kids for God's sake!"

"Yeah." Dylan grimaces. "Bryce might be okay, since he's so young and all, but I'd take the Under on Lil' Abby turning out alright."

Howard's ears flush beat red as adrenaline surges through his short, trembling frame. At this point, every patron in the bar has their phone out as a hulking bouncer emerges from a room in the back and makes a b-line, barreling for the pair.

'You'll probably see her on the pole in ten years. Or OnlyFans."

"I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU!" Howard screams, lunging for the bettor-bastard's neck.

"If you want, we could put 20 bucks on—HGRK!"
