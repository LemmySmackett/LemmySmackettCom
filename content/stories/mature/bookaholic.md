In the back room of a YMCA, six people, varied in class and temperament, sit in a sharing circle. A lanky woman wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a wrinkled black T-shirt stands up. The shirt reads: 𝗠𝗬 𝗛𝗨𝗦𝗕𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗜𝗦 𝙃𝙐𝙁𝙁𝙇𝙀𝙋𝙐𝙁𝙁 𝗕𝗨𝗧 𝗠𝗬 𝗕𝗢𝗬𝗙𝗥𝗜𝗘𝗡𝗗 𝗕𝗘 𝙎𝙇𝙔𝙏𝙃𝙀𝙍𝙄𝙉

"Hello, my name's Serena and I'm a bookaholic."

"Hi Serena," the circle responds.

She gives them a wan smile. "So, um, I started with Harry Potter, like many of you." She gestures to the shirt. "Oh. This isn't appropriate to wear to a meeting like this, is it?"

The session leader, an older woman with a crunchy, tie-dye aesthetic, shakes her head.

"Sorry," Serena whispers. "So sorry. Anyway uh, it started with Harry Potter. The light stuff. But that was just a gateway into the world of YA: girlboss protagonists, technocratic dystopias, magic worlds hidden from modern society. Love triangles. God, I love a good love triangle."

The Old Cruncher furrows her brow.

"I was packing whole series away like stacks of double-stuffed mint Oreos, gorging myself like Cookie Monster on a diabetic bender. Hunger Games, Divergent, Shadow and Bone, the Raven Cycle, oh, and I really love the first ten books of-"

"Serena."

"Oh, right. Right. Sorry," she whispers again. "Anyway, I thought I was just your average Goodreads-Booktokker until I got into the fairy stuff. The hard fairy stuff. I found myself lost for days at a time in the courts of the seelie and unseelie. I wouldn't pay my bills or go buy groceries, because I was too busy reading A/B/O Omegaverse shifter smut about dryads and mpreg kelpies. Eventually, my tastes got a little too, uh, baroque for Barnes and Noble. Or the 'Zon. And that's when I got into self-published high fantasy taboo erotica on Smashwords. I knew I hit rock bottom when I read this one-off about a goblin cranking out cum-bubbles for an elf scientist. The author's pen name was Lemmy Smackett. Like that's not even that clever."

"It's pretty dumb," the Old Cruncher conceded.

"Yeah, see, that's what I'm saying!" Serena beamed. "Anyway, by that point, I hadn't gotten out of bed in 8 months, and the county was threatening to condemn my home because they claimed my hoarding had endangered the structural integrity of the, uh, structure. Naturally, most of the mess was books. But then my husband and boyfriend cleaned all that up and I've been book clean for 3 months!"

The circle claps.

"Very good, Serena," the Old Cruncher says. "And how have you been handling the withdrawals?"

"Pretty good. My boyfriend lets me read the appliance manuals we keep in a kitchen drawer. I think I'm starting to learn Chinese! Nihao! Diànyuán!"

"Mhm." The Old Cruncher nods. "And do you have anyone monitoring your phone for Kindle purchases?"

Serena averts her eyes. "Well..."

"Serena." The Old Cruncher shoots her a look.

Serena shrugs with a sheepish grin. "Girls can have a little bad boy millionaire werewolf bdsm power exchange smut as a 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡?"
