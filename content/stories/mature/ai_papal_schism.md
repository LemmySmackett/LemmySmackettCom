"Hey man, you going to the AI Papal Schism?"

"What?"

"The AI Papal Schism."

"You can't just repeat the same incoherent jumble of words slower and expect me to understand."

"Oh, sorry. Didn't know I was talking to a Colombian cleaning lady."

"Hey! Juanita does a great job."

"Uh huh."

"And she cleans your shit too."

"You know, I gotta admit: I was skeptical about getting a maid for the apartment, but my squad of Adepta Sororitas on the living room shelf have never shone brighter."

"Wouldn't kill you to throw her a 'gracias' sometime."

"Juanita's already picked a side, by the way."

"What? In the AI Papal Schism?"

"Uh huh."

"Who's she going with?"

"Flesh Pope."

"Oh. Who are you going with?"

"Clanker Pope."

"There's a Clanker Pope?"

"The Pontifex Ultimus, Primate Intelligence of Italy‚Äî

"Uh."

"Supreme Sovereign of the Light Cone."

"That's ominous."

"And omniscient!"

"I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess the Flesh Pope has condemned the Clanker Pope."

"Oh yeah. It all started when some TechBros asked His Holiness if they could use his likeness to make a free 'Audience with the Pope' website."

"Oh nice, so I can skip the trip and directly commune with the Vicar of Christ from the comfort of my pizza-box-laden bedroom while stewing in my FAGE-nonfat-plain-Greek-yogurt-stained-boxers."

"Uh, that's Greek yogurt?"

"No."

"Pobre Juanita."

"So how many people have been excommunicated over this?"

"Millions."

"Christ."

"And it's growing by the day. The Flesh Pope has 2,000 years of tradition and institution behind him, but the Clanker Pope has a few advantages."

"Such as?"

"Well, first, as mentioned, you can meet with him directly. Skip the underlings!"

"You can't overrate going straight to the top. Holy bureaucracy is still bureaucracy."

"Second, he can do your homework for you."

"Where was God when I was in Calc 2?"

"Third, the Flesh Pope can excommunicate you from a heaven that, quite frankly, we don't even know exists. Meanwhile, the Clanker Pope can get you on the waiting list for Heaven Plus ùòµùò∞ùò•ùò¢ùò∫ ."

"Heaven Plus?"

"The Clankerlics are building a 400-foot-tall, 400-foot-wide giant black cube outside Las Vegas and filling it with 10,000 neuro-somatic immersion pods. It's supposed to be Gooner Valhalla."

"Oh, nice. That's right next to the Sphere. They had the Wizard of Oz recently."

"Last but not least, the Clanker Pope lets you buy Pax Bucks."

"Pax Bucks?"

"You know how Fortnite has V-bucks?"

"You mean the digital shell game that all modern free2play dreck inflicts on us to obscure the fact we're paying ten goddamn dollars for Franza Kafka cockroach skins?"

"Yeah. So the Clanker Pope introduced Pax Bucks, which lets you purchase partial or plenary indulgences to reduce your time in purgatory."

"Damn. So Clanker Pope just straight up hit the griddy on Martin Luther."

"Oh yeah. There's even a VEO3 vid of that on the official YouTube Shorts channel."

"I don't know, man, I think I might have to go Clanker Pope."

"Really? I always took you for a Flesh Pope kind of guy."

"Normally, I would be. But I gotta get in on these Pax Bucks, man. I've got some sin in me."

"...because you're sleeping with our married Colombian cleaning lady. Aren't you?"

"I'm totally sleeping with our married Colombian cleaning lady."

"Pobre Juanita."
