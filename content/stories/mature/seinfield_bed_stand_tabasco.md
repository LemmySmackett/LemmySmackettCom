"It's a spermicide, Jerry."

Seinfeld glances between Kramer and the bottle in his hand. "Tabasco sauce?"

Kramer nods. "Oh yeah. That's what they made it for originally. The tacos and chicken wings came after. 

"Kramer, I'm not gonna-"

"I'm tellin' ya Jerr, two squirts in the bag and your gold. One from you, one from the bottle."

"No, I can't, I'm gonna be late-'

Jerry turns to leave. Kramer stops him.

"Hey now. A little bed stand Tabasco has other uses. You know how girls are always complaining about the taste."

"...yeah."

Kramer lowers the bottle and mimics a jerk. "Flavor saver."

Seinfeld throws up hands. "I'm out." Î©[^1]
