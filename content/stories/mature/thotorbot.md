Dude, did you see that video of Brad Pitt fighting Tom Cruise to the death to defend Jeffrey Epstein's honor?"

"Wild stuff huh?"

"Yeah. I couldn't believe he did that."

"You couldn't believe who did what?"

"I told you: Brad Pitt fought Tom Cruise to defend Epstein's honor—"

"Uh."

"—and then Tom Cruise blew his brains out. They were fighting on the rooftop of a war-torn city or something."

"Bro."

"Looked like Vancouver."

"That was AI."

"Damn. Really?"

"Yeah, man."

"So...Brad Pitt is still alive?"

"Yeah!"

"That's annoying."

"Sorry you had to find out this way."

"Man, AI shit is everywhere these days. Hell, I even saw a video of some guy called Bad Bunny performing the Super Bowl halftime show."

"Actually, that happened."

"Damn. Really?"

"Yeah."

"In Spanish?"

"Uh huh."

"The whole thing."

"The whole thing."

"Cónchale..."

"Sorry you had to find out this way."

"Dude, somebody needs to make an 'isitreal dot com' or something."

"A what?"

"You know, a Slopes for reality."

"Isn't Slopes already a Slopes for reality?"

"You know what I mean! A better Slopes. Faster. Crowd-sourced or something."

"Ah, I know what you need. Remember HotorNot?"

"Uh, the early-2000s pre-social media site where hideous forum trolls perused pictures of random women and rated them on a scale of 1 to 10?"

"Yep. They brought it back—"

"How does that help—"

"—as ThotorBot."

"¿Cómo?"

"It's a new site designed to identify and monitor whether any given woman on the internet is a thot or a bot."

"Wait a minute. Hold on."

"Great stuff, right?"

"Every woman on the internet is not a thot."

"Au contraire. Remember the Facebook shadow profile fiasco from a few years back?"

"The one where we found out that Zuck and his Meta minions generated millions of profiles for people who weren't even members?"

"Yep. Turns out a Romanian cyber cartel exfiltrated the aggregated data and used it to set up EveryThot—an OnlyFans for every woman in America."

"Really?"

"Really. They're aiming to have every foid on the planet catalogued right before ASI hits."

"Dude. Butlerian Jihadist Barbie is gonna be huge at Halloween this year.

"So now every woman is a thot, whether they want it or not, but with all the bots running around, it's still critical to confirm if your favorite thot is a bot."

"Okay, Dr. Seuss. So like, how does the website verify people?"

"Like the original HotorNot, the site allows users to vote on thots, but this time it's on a 10-point scale of genuine humanity."

"Just what the original HotOrNot was missing."

"True."

"But that still doesn't seem particularly rigorous. Or dispositive."

"It's not, which is why they also tap into Palantir's API."

"Oye, pero espérate."

"Who knew one half-time show could make a gringo fluent?"

"You're telling me the Romanian cyber cartel site that catalogues every woman in America using stolen data dossiers compiled without the consent or knowledge of the American people is tapping into the same API used by the American government's own national surveillance infrastructure?"

"That's about the size of it." 

"Mierda…"

"Trump signed the Executive Order last month."

"Why the hell would he do that?"

"Well, the Chinese ambassador made a post on Xitter claiming that all our best thots were bots."

"Okay."

"And Trump shot back on Truth social that 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺 Chinese thot is a bot, or as he likes to call them: Chots."

"So we're exploring new avenues for racism in the Singularity then."

"It seems that way."

"And people claim AI can replace us."

"The point is that this administration will not allow any nation on this planet to surpass us in Thot Supremacy."

"Inspiring."

"I thought so. The site also has some features that prevent a thot from going bot."

"Going bot?"

"At any given time a woman could 'go bot' and let an AI completely automate her online presence: generate photos and videos, handle her DMs, yadda yadda."

"I suppose so."

"To prevent this, the site allows users to deploy an autonomous surveillance drone to confirm what any thot is doing at given moment."

"I'm running out of festive Spanish exasperation, man."

"They're calling it—"

"Wait, let me guess. The Thotnopticon."

"In the site's defense, every thot on EveryThot earns revenue from the drone streams."

"Nice."

"Based on view count, of course."

"So UBI is solved."

"And all women had to do was relinquish the last vestiges of privacy against their will. Here check it out."

"I'd rather not."

"Come on, just look at this one thot."

"Ugh. Alright."

"So what do you think?"

"Redhead huh? Well, I mean, she seems friendly. Next door type. Wholesome."

"Except for the exposed hole, of course."

"Except for the exposed hole. I'm gonna vote a 10. Pure Thot."

"Oof. Sorry man."

“Cónchale...”

"She's actually a 1. Full bot. See this is exactly why—dude are you alright?"

"I'll be okay."

"You looked 𝘥𝘦𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘥."

"I'm sorry. It's just—"

"What?"

"She seemed so attainable."
