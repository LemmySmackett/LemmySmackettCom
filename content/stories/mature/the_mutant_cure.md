"Hello, you’re watching NBC. I’m Ellen Skunt. For the past sixty years, 𝐻𝑛𝑔ℎ America has grappled with the Mutant Question. With the FDA’s recent approval of Trask Industries' so-called Mutant Cure, some now argue it should be administered alongside the Hepatitis B vaccine, a mandatory immunization given to all newborns. 𝑀𝑚𝑚. Tonight, we’re speaking with a panel of voters across the political spectrum, one of whom is secretly a mutant. We’ll reveal their identity at the end of the show. 𝑈𝑔ℎ. 𝑎ℎ𝑒𝑚𝑚. Let’s start with you, Ivanna."

“Hi, I’m Ivanna Rutt. 𝐻𝑛𝑔ℎ. Minnesota Democrat. And I just think 𝑀𝑚𝑚 it’s such a shame what we're doing to the Homo Superior people.”

“Jesus. Look, Buster Himen here. Kentucky Republican. 𝐻𝑛𝑔ℎ. And there ain’t nothin’ superior about these muties. They’re freaks, okay? You liberals are always going on about your made-up '''sensible''' gun control, but I’ve never fired an AR that can level Detroit!”

“They can’t help it, Buster. 𝑈𝑔ℎ. They were born that way. You just want to eradicate them like the LGBT!”

“If every gay man in America could torch my kids by shooting fire out of his flaming ass, you bet your butt I’d have them eradicated! 𝐺𝑟𝑢𝑢𝑢ℎ. 𝑆𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑦. If these muties have a right to their powers at birth, then every newborn should be issued a government-mandated Glock! And hey, just sayin’, it doesn’t eradicate a baby to not have a Glock!”

“Oh, so you do support sensible gun control.”

“$@#% you.”

“A tense debate. Let’s go to our last voter: Macon Quiver.”

“Thank you, Skunt. The anxiety around Homo Superior is perfectly understandable. Logical, even. In some ways, the very existence of mutants flies in the face of our founding ideals as a nation: how can it be that all men are created equal, if some can move mountains with their minds?"

"Mhm."

"But if we stop to think about it, what are we really afraid of? Crime? If the Cold War showed us anything, it’s that a bad-ten-year-old-with-nuclear-death-ray-eyes can only be stopped by a good-ten-year-old-with-nuclear-death-ray-eyes. Telepaths? One in eight Americans is on SSRIs, and many report feelings of depression and/or despondency. If you can't stand to be alone with your own thoughts, why wouldn't you let someone else take control? Release yourself from the burdens of executive function. You already do it with ChatGPT.”

“Sounds like 𝐻𝑛𝑔ℎ commie mutie gobbledygook to me.”

“𝑀𝑚𝑚 Mr. Himen, please𝑒𝑒𝑒.”

“It’s alright, Skunt. As you said at the start of the show, one of us is a mutant. Or a mutie, as our rural friend so brashly puts it. And I am that mutie.”

“Mr. Quiver, why come out now? Are you concerned that Trask’s vaccine could 𝑈𝑔ℎ end the mutant race?”

“Oh ho, not at all. Even if it went to a congressional vote, one telepath could sway the minds of a few senators. Or all of them. How would anyone ever know?”

“𝑈𝑔ℎ 𝑜ℎ 𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑑. Then w-why?”

“Because I’m tired of lying about who I am, Skunt. Who we are. Mutants are the superior race. Born to rule. We will govern this world better than you ever did and you’ll willingly surrender yourselves to our gentle guiding hand, or my name isn’t Forced Orgasms Man!”

“𝐻𝑁𝑛𝐺𝑔ℎℎ𝐹𝑈𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑘𝑘𝑘!”

“𝑂-𝑂𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑂𝑂𝑂𝐻 𝐺𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑑𝑑𝑑!”

“I knew it! Mutie scu𝑈𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑂𝐻!”
