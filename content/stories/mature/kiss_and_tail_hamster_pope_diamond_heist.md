At the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, in the pin-drop hush of the twilight hours, two sinuous shadows slither down a rope hanging from an open skylight. Clad in lace-up stiletto boots and matching skin-tight vinyl catsuits, they're the notorious cat-thief duo—Kiss & Tail!

With panther's grace, Kiss lands on the marble tiles of the Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals. "We're in." She slinks through the gloom, past the Presidential Jewels exhibit, and presses herself against a wall, beside a narrow hallway entrance.

"Weird." Tail hits the floor in a lithe, cinematic squat. "You'd think a diamond worth a quarter-billion dollars would have better security."

"Get over here!" Kiss hisses.

"Oop." Tail slinks over and presses herself against the wall. "I'm just saying, it's the Hope Diamond—from Titanic, for God's sake."

"That's not the Hope Diamond." Kiss checks around the corner.

"Oh?"

"That's the Heart of the Ocean."

"Oh."

"James Cameron just based it on the Hope Diamond.

Tail frowns. "Well, that's disappointing."

"How is that disappointing?" Kiss looks back. 

Tail shrugs. "I always thought it was cool Rose threw the real Hope Diamond in the ocean. You know, at the end of the movie?"

Kiss levels her gaze. "Tail, if the jewel we were after was at the bottom of the ocean, we'd have to 𝘨𝘰 to the bottom of ocean to get it."

"Yeah I know," Tail says. "But I  figured James Cameron already did that."

"What?"

"Titanic was filmed a long time ago."

Kiss knits her brow. "You thought James Cameron tossed the Hope Diamond into the ocean, for a movie, and then got it back himself?"

"Uh huh." Tail nods. "I bet he just makes up excuses to ride around in those cute little deep sea submersibles."

Kiss shakes her head.

"To be fair, I would too."

"Whatever, we're not even after the Hope diamond."

"We're not?"

"No." Kiss checks the corner again. "We're after the Pope Popes Poping diamond."

Tail blinks. "The Pope Popes Poping diamond?"

"It's an even bigger diamond that was cut down to look like the hamster pope pfp of a whimsical 30k follower shitpost account on X, the Everything App."

"What? Why on earth would anyone do that?"

Kiss looks back. "For the bit."

"Ah, right." Tail clicks her tongue. "The bit."

"Now the only thing standing between us and our coveted catholic crystalline cricetine prize is an 80-foot long, 4-foot wide corridor filled with a small platoon of 300 lb security guards, each bigger than the last, all built like linebackers on an anabolic bender."

"Um."

"I'm talking no less than 25 tren-pumped, roid-gut gorilla-goons who have long since shed the last vestiges of their humanity and are now more beast than man."

"Uuum."

"Like RFK."

"Right."

"Naturally, we'll have to fight our way through."

"Okay."

Kiss locks eyes with Tail. "You watched the video I sent you, right? From TikTok?"

Tail nods. "The Gaslight Girlboss Scissor Takedown Supercut set to David Guetta's Titanium, featuring Sia."

"Right, so we just do that." Kiss turns to enter the hallway. "On my mark. Ready?"

Tail shifts. "Um, actually I had a question."

Kiss turns back. "Ugh. What now?"

"So like, we're just going to run into a football team's worth of gargantuan gearheads and throw our legs around their heads?"

"Right, just like in the video." Kiss nods. "You just do some acrobatics to get up on those beefy, meat-slab shoulders, lock your supple, toned thighs tight around the goon's head, and get a nice, suffocating squeeze going." Kiss turns away. "Ready?"

"Oookay," Tail squeaks, uncertain. "And then we take them down using centripetal force?" She ventures.

Kiss furrows her brow. "What?"

"Or like, momentum?"

Kiss looks back. "Momentum?"

"Torque maybe?"

"What?"

"Like I swing the weight of my body and it causes the guy to fall over." Tail swings her arms.

Kiss scoffs. 

"Right?"

"No."

"No?"

"No!" Kiss straightens. "There's no way any woman as light as us could use momentum to flip a 300lb man. Or even a 200lb man!"

"There isn't?"

"No! Look, you're like what, 115lbs wet?"

"Actually, I'm even lighter when I'm wet."

"Huh?"

"When my boyfriend picks me up and carries me to the bedroom, he says I'm light as a feather."

"Tail."

"And then he slaps my butt!"

Kiss reaches out and slaps her face.

"Oy!"

"Focus."

"Yes, mommy."

"If you try to use momentum or centripetal force or whatever to throw a man with even an ounce of muscle on him, he's just going to pry you off like Raggedy Ann and body slam your dumb, bimbo butt."

Tail rubs her cheek, chastened. "Well then what am I supposed to use?"

Kiss squats and slaps the interior of her high sheen thighs. "These bad girls right here."

"Huh?"

Kiss sighs. "You didn't even watch the video, did you?"

"I had it on." Tail mumbles, puffing her cheeks. "I was multi-tasking..."

Kiss rolls her eyes. "Look, it's all science. When you squeeze your vinyl-coated thighs tight around the goon's head, it initiates an instantaneous orgasmic release—"

"Orgasmic release??"

"—and 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵'𝘴 when you flip 'em."

"Wait a minute, hold on." Tail recoils. "You're telling me every time the scissor throw works, it's 'cause the guy gets off on it??"

"Of course. They're goons."

"Gross!"

"They're perpetually edging."

"Double gross!"

"How else would it work?" 

"I don't know!"

"It's the whole reason we're wearing these impractical zip-up vinyl catsuits with fuck-me-pumps."

"That's why we're wearing these catsuits??"

"Uh huh."

"I just thought they were cute!"

"Obviously," Kiss scoffs. "Now listen close, because this last part is the most important."

"I don't think I want to hear anymore..."

"After you put the goon on the ground, you toss in a little CBT to finish 'em off."

Tail gives Kiss a hesitant look. "...you mean cognitive behavioral—"

"Cock and ball torture." Kiss mimics a crotch jab. "It's like a double tap for the dick."

"Ugh."

"If we move fast enough, we should have about thirty minutes of collective refractory period to get in and out."

"...."

"And that's not counting the poor bastards done in by steroid-induced ED and hypogonadism."

Tail squints. "You learned all this from a TikTok supercut?"

"And a Judo master at SlutCon. Alright, ready?"

"Yeah, no, I'm not going." Tail turns away, heading straight for the rope.

"What?"

"I'm not jerking off a bunch of needle jockeys. It's not even the stupid diamond from Titanic!"

"Tail! Hey! You don't gotta jerk 'em off! You just gotta pop 'em in the balls!"

"I'm going back home!" Tail shouts back. "To my 𝘣𝘰𝘺𝘧𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘥."

Kiss raises her arms. "Tail! Come on!"

"The goons can keep the dumb hamster!"

"Tail!"

Tail grabs holds of the rope and spins around. "I've got one question."

"What?"

"What happens if it doesn't work?"

"You mean, what happens if we do the scissor thigh move but our opponent isn't a perpetually edging goon?"

"Uh huh," Tail says. "And he's wearing a cup."

"𝘈𝘯𝘥 a cup?"

"Uh huh."

"That's easy," Kiss says. " We die."
