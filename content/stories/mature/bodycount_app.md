Dude, have you seen this? The number one app in the world is Yelp for Dudes."

"Eh?"

"It's called Tea. Girls get on there anonymously and talk about the guys they're dating—like if he's a player with a bad mustache or a serial killer or whatever."

"Ah, yeah. The Gender War stuff is getting out of hand."

"No shit."

"That's why I'm on Bodycount."

"Bodycount?"

"Check it out. It's an app that lets you publicly catalogue every woman you've ever slept with."

"Dude, shut up. There's no way."

"Yeah, man. Here's my profile."

"Haha, holy shit. Linda, Amy...Man, I knew you slept with that Lin chick at Bryan's party!"

"Yeah, that was a bit of a tight fit."

"Oh yeah?"

"She called me Big Trouble in Little China."

"Autumn, Nia, Sara—hold up. You slept with Jenny?"

"Mhmm.

"My Jenny?"

"You're Jenny. And Jenny Stefanopoulos. And Jenny Weissman. Real throat goat that one. Yours was better in the sack though."

"Before or after?"

"Before or after what?

"Before or after we dated, dickhead!"

"Oh. Before..."

"Alright well that's—"

"And After."

"Dude!"

"Like immediately after."

"Son of a bitch."

"There are timestamps, see?"

"The app catalogues when you hit it 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘴𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘥?"

"Yeah, it syncs with my Apple watch."

"How the—"

"It detects when I'm doing horizontal cardio and uses an advanced form of Wi-Fi Sensing to identify the person underneath me. Or on top. Whatever."

"Dude! It's an Orwellian Pussy Panopticon."

"Yeah."

"Wait, there's a 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘣𝘰𝘢𝘳𝘥?"

"A 𝘨𝘭𝘰𝘣𝘢𝘭 leaderboard."

"I don't even—"

"You can sort by Most Girls Laid, Longest Session, Highest Decibel Level Achieved—"

"This app is 𝘧𝘶𝘤𝘬𝘦𝘥."

"And you can see how many guys a girl has slept with too."

"No."

"Yeah."

"...I could see every guy Jenny has slept with since we broke up?"

"Sure, we just go to her profile."

"Don't!"

"Eh?"

"Just don't. Show me something else. Anything else."

"Alright well uh...."

"I think I'm gonna throw up."

"Here we go: the leaderboard for Most Guys Banged (by Girl). They call it the Whoreboard. See?"

"Number 1 is Sydney Sweeney?"

"Yep."

"I'm supposed to believe Sydney Sweeney has banged ten million men?"

"Self-reports."

"I was gonna say, that doesn't seem mathematically possible."

"Number 2 is Scarlet Johansson."

"So what? Every guy in the world claims they slept with Sydney Sweeney and Scarlet Johansson?" 

"Why not? The whole top ten are considered freebies."

"I guess."

"Check out number 3."

"The green triceratops chick from Barney?"

"Uh huh. Guys dig the horns."

"I thought I was the only one."

"And number four is...well, anyway, that's the app."

"What? Show me number four dude."

"You don't want to see it."

"Come on, it can't be any worse than finding out my best friend sloppy-joe'd the Love of my Life literally five minutes and 32 seconds after we broke up."

"There's always a deeper pit, kid."

"...no."

"Here she is."

"My Jenny."

"Yep."

"Number Four."

"Number One if you uncheck self-reports."

"...damn."
