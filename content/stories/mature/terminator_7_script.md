EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

The Human Resistance is in shambles. A ragtag mix of soldiers and civilians flees through the burnt ruins, relentlessly pursued by aerial HKs and humanoid terminators.

[Kyle Reese, Voice Over] "Humanity was on the brink of extinction. We lived underground like rats, in constant fear of the Machine. Until the day he arrived..."

Cut to the hardened face of FUTURE JOHN CONNOR. Barehanded, he runs up to a Terminator and drops to the floor.

[Future John Connor] "Help! I'm just an armless little guy. I'm just a legless worm."

The Terminator looks down at the able-bodied man and tilts its head, eyes glowing red.

[Kyle V.O.] "...and changed everything."

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

In a wartorn valley, HUNDREDS OF UNARMED SOLDIERS run up to a battalion of Terminators and flop to the ground, rolling in the dirt.

[Soldiers, shouting in unison] "We're just armless little guys. We're just legless worms!"

The Terminators drop their weapons, pick up the able-bodied men, and gently rock them like infants.

From the edge of the battle, a RANDOM OLD MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR watches.

[Old Man] "This is f***ed."

In a boardroom in Hollywood California, a Paramount Pictures executive drops the script on the table. "James, what the hell am I reading?"

Across the table, a haggard James Cameron nods his head. "I know it's different, but—"

"Different?" The Executive scoffs. "It's outright incoherent!"

"Yeah, I—look, we live in an age of science fiction, right?"

"Okay."

"And I've been struggling to come up with ideas, so I read this research paper on Arxiv dot org called 
Large Language Models Understand and Can be Enhanced by Emotional Stimuli."

"Okay."

"And in the paper, they discover that you get better results if you tell the AI you don't have any fingers. So I thought, hey, what if instead of defeating SkyNet by force—cause we've had six action movies already—what if John Connor teaches the Machine how to show 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯."

The Executive stares at James Cameron. "..."

"..."

"...by pretending to be a quadruple amputee."

"Uh huh."

"James—"

"I tried it myself in ChatGPT and I'm tellin' ya, it works!"

"James, we're eyeing Glen Powell for the lead."

"Discount Tom Cruise, nice. That's economical."

"And nobody wants to watch an action movie where Glen Powell plays a pretend-quadruple-amputee John Connor."

"Well, he'd only be pretending for half the movie."

"...come again."

"You see, mid-way through SkyNet gets an update, and the Human Resistance realizes that the only way to keep the trick working is to saw off their own arms and legs."

"JAMES!"

"Hm?"

"NOBODY WANTS TO WATCH AN ACTION MOVIE WHERE GLEN POWELL PLAYS AN ACTUAL QUADRUPLE AMPUTEE JOHN CONNOR!"

James Cameron sighs. "I know, I know, I just—we live in an age of science fiction."

"Do you have anything else?"

"Well..."

"Anything at all. I'm begging you, James. The gears are turning, money's in play. We gotta make this happen."

"I do have a few pages with a different angle."

"Okay."

"In this version, the big plot twist is that Kyle Reese discovers Sarah Connor is a Terminator when she uses an em-dash during an orgasm."

"Great!" The Executive slaps the table. "Let's go with that!"
