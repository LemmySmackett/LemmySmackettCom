The government has been taken over by backwater fundie fascist prudes."

"Fuckin' A."

"That's why we have to preserve all the art and culture we can. You've seen what they've done to the government. Those bastards will destroy everything they can get their hands on."

"Fuckin' A man!"

"That's why I'm going straight to Xvideos dot com and downloading all the 'Step-sister Stuck' porn I can find."

"Fuckin'...ùò∏ùò©ùò¢ùòµ?"

"We have to preserve all the pornography we can before they delete it off the internet."

"Uh, shouldn't we, like, try to mobilize a ground game. Get people to vote for us in the midterms?"

"It's too late for that. Now look here: I've got my folders all set up. I'm categorizing every 'Step-sister Stuck' video by furniture."

"Bro."

"Stuck in the Washing Machine. Stuck under the Bed."

"I'm not sure this is the best use of our time. Besides isn't like 80% of the internet pure porn? How would they‚Äî"

"Stuck in a Window. Stuck in the Chimney."

"Wait. In the Bottom of the Chimney or the Top of the Chimney?"

"I have folders for both. When she's stuck in the Top of of the Chimney, the step-brother is usually dressed as Santa Claus."

"Diabolical."

"Stuck in a Double Decker Couch."

"Yeah, I just feel like, we could do something different, ya know? Maybe go door to door. Get the word out. Do some house calls."

"There's no time for that."

"A townhall meeting..."

"Democracy has Fallen! Now take this laptop. You're on Hypno-sissy duty."

"Bro."

"Take it!

"Bro, I don't want to be on Hypno-sissy duty!"

"This isn't about what we want! This about preservation of liberty! And freedom!"

"Man."

"And frilly pink panties."

"Bro please."

"With naughty little cock cages."

"I can't‚Äî"

"So that's how it is, huh? You were with the fascists all along."

"I'm not with the fascists! I just don't want to be on Hypno-sissy duty. Look, put me on Sister/Daddy Swap duty."

"Got it."

"What?"

"I've got it."

"All of it?"

"10,876 Petabytes."

"Jesus. Uh, Shoplifter Dubcon. Massage Dubcon."

"Got it. Got it."

"Fuck. Uh, uh, Mother/Son Swap! Paid House Maids! Slutty Babysitters Punished by their Cheating DILF Employers!"

"Got it. Got it. Got it."

"God DAMMIT."

"Sorry man. Hypno-sissy is all that's left."

[pouting] "...you did this on purpose."

"Shush now. Take the laptop."

"I just want you to know..."

 "And the cat ears."

"...I'm only doing this for democracy."

"Mhm. Of course you are, Kitten." Œ©
