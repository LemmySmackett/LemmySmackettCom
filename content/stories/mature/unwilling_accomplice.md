I was sure I heard Danny wrong.

We were on his back patio lounging on zero gravity mesh recliners equipped with dual cup holders, USB-C charging ports, and personal misting fans, watching the last skyborne wisps of orange and pink fade with the setting sun. The muffled strings of Fleet Foxes droned from the wall-mounted Sonos speakers. 

"Sorry, I didn't catch that," I said.

Danny popped another Fat Tire Ale and took a swig. "I'd make a good serial killer."

Okay. Turns out I had caught that.

"Define 'good'."

Danny shrugged. "You know how Linda's always watching the True Crime Network. Listening to all those podcasts?"

I nodded. Danny's wife loved hearing about women being brutally murdered. My girlfriend did too. Hell, these days she couldn't fall asleep unless she had those damn AirPods on, even after sex. Just lying there, slick with sweat, listening to two harpies sloshed on boxed chardonnay cackle about some naive small-town prom queen that got kidnapped, dismembered, and crammed into a couple of 50-gallon Kirkland Signature trash bags. That was her melatonin—her lullaby.

Women are sick that way.

"I just think that a lot of those killers make very basic mistakes," he said. "Simple stuff."

"Like what?" I had long accepted that Danny was screwed in the head. Who isn't?

"Bad targets for one."

I twirled my hand. "Such as..."

Danny bolted forward, holding up a finger. "First off, anyone you know is right out. Friends and acquaintances are the first leads for police."

"Hm. Makes sense."

He held up a second finger. "Attractive college-aged white girls. They always end up in the news."

I took a swig and mulled it over. "I guess so." Danny knew I once had aspirations to be a reporter—the kind of guy who'd tell you all about the dead white girls and their loving, worried families cloistered away back in some posh New England neighborhood.

Now I just churned out AI-generated MMMF Omegaverse Reverse Harem Shifter-Billionaire Mdom for KDP Select. It pays. 

Danny nodded sagely. "News orgs never miss the opportunity to plaster beautiful women all over the screen. Men love it. Women love it. The worse off, the better. Guaranteed ratings."

"So what are you going to be?" I smirked. "The Hambeast Hunter?"

Danny scowled. He held up a third and final finger. "Mixing business with pleasure. As soon as you get libido involved, you're thinking with the wrong head. You gotta go after vagrants, people no one cares about—at least at first, while you're still developing your skill set. Especially with all the surveillance. Ring cameras alone rule out the average hood."

I cocked a brow. "You have thought about this." The conversation was getting uncomfortable. This line of thinking was deranged, even by Danny's standards.

"But at the same time," he continued. "There's no point if nobody ever finds out about it, right?"

"Um."

Danny leaned in, a strange glimmer dancing in his eyes. "These serial killers, man, I've realized something. I had this epiphany. Something the girls understand, if only intuitively. These killers get all these shows, all this attention, right? You see, it's because these are the last free men. The only ones worth mythologizing. The Alexanders of our age. The literal Genghis Khans of our time."

I blinked and snorted. "Danny, I don't think Genghis Khan was hunting hobos under the overpasses of the Mongolian steppes."

"No," He stood up and walked over to his workbench. A duffel bag bulging with God-knows-what sat on the countertop. "But Temujin did murder his brother."

I wasn't sure who Temujin was and I didn't care to find out. 

"Well, with any luck, they'll give him ten to twenty. My girl's waiting for me back home, man. I gotta head out."

Danny rooted around in the bag, ignoring me. He was a nice enough guy but he always got a little loopy at night. Poor bastard was sundowning in his thirties. 

I polished my beer off and stood to leave. The world tilted. One too many, as usual.

As I gripped the recliner to steady myself, Danny shoved a digital camcorder in my other hand. "I need you to be my cameraman." He clasped my fingers over the strap. "My Chronicler."

"Chronicler? What are we gonna do, my liege?" I half-slurred through a hiccup. "Make some TikToks?"

I flipped the LCD screen out and pointed the camera at him. Danny appeared in a full-face respirator mask and butcher's smock, wielding a cattle stun gun.

"Not exactly."
