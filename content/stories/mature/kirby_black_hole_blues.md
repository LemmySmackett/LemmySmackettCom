Richard Marlowe took a bottle from the top drawer of his sagging, paper-strewn desk and poured a glass of whiskey. Raindrops drizzled on the windowpane like tears at a funeral. The city was a corpse and he was just another scavenger, working for his piece of the carcass. Not one of the respectable scavengers, mind you, like a coyote or vulture. More like a blowfly. Or a carrion beetle.

That's what it meant to be a Private Eye in a town like this.

He knocked back the whiskey and washed it down with a shot of Mexican vodka. He was pouring a flagon of Cuban absinthe when she came in.

The Dame strutted through the door, all legs with skin pink as bubblegum. Her head and torso were a single plush ball with perfect curves—360 degrees of simmering sensuality. Two rosy dots punctuated the alluring smile on her supple cheeks. 

Richard gulped and shifted in his seat. A girl like this did things to a man.

The Dame reached his desk. "Hiiiiiiii!" she waved her stubby fin arm.

Richard smirked. The cheery type, huh? She must have been from out of town. This city had a way of beating the joy out of people, like an overworked dominatrix on a bad day who just found out you don't have a buck in your pocket or a penny to your name. A common quandary for Richard. 

The joke was on the dom, though—he got what he came for either way.

Richard leaned back in his chair. "What can I do for you, sweetheart?"

Idly he wondered what she could do 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘩𝘪𝘮 with a mouth like that. He found out when she unhinged her jaw like a Burmese Python and sucked him in— desk, whiskey, and all—with the gravitational force of a supermassive black hole.

Women.
