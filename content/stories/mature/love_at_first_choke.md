At the end of a breathless first date brimming with drunken laughter, shameless teasing, and lingering glances of aching need, Calvin and Iris barely make it through the front door of her cluttered college apartment before clawing each other's clothes off.

Two minutes into tonsil-boxing and wrist-deep waistband exploration, Calvin stumbles over a stray pile of stilettos and finally takes a look around. "Damn bitch, you live like thi—woah!"

Iris falls back onto a laundry-strewn couch, pulling him along. "Shut up and fuck me, smartass."

Calvin falls on top of her and shimmies his boxers off, eager to comply.

Moments later, her moans fill the room, their bodies writhing as one. "Yes, YES!" Iris cranes her head back, exposing her neck. "Choke me."

Calvin halts. "Like Ted Bundy or Jack Harlow?"

"Choke me!" She demands.

"Alright, alright." He lays his hand on her throat. "I didn't take you for the Fifty Shades type."

"Harder."

"I'm not sure this is safe—"

"Harder!" She barks like a drill instructor.

"Yes sir, Sgt. Hartman Sir!" Calvin flexes his fingers, applying a firm but gentle pressure.

“Smartass," she smirks.
Then, beneath the weight of his hand, her expression shifts—minute flickers of strained pleasure. Micro-movements of erotic distress.
Something ancient stirs within Calvin.
Primal. Inherited. Atavistic.
Driven by the sight and sound of her subtle sinuous struggle, his fingers sink further and further into tender, yielding flesh.
Tighter.
Tighter.
𝘛𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵𝘦𝘳.

"Jesus," he mutters as the Modern Fears of a Modern Man take hold. "We should stop." He releases his grip. "I don't want to—"

Cobra-quick, her legs wrap around his waist, locking him in place. "Don't. You. Dare."

"Iris, come on. This is dangerous."

"Yes." Her hands caress his youthful, wiry muscles. "It is dangerous," she coos. "Incredibly. Sensuously." Soft as sable-tipped brushes, her slender fingertips trace over his broad shoulders and down the vascular map of his biceps and forearms. "Ravenously dangerous."

Calvin gulps, tossing a silent prayer up to heaven.

"But I trust you." She purrs. "And I 𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘥 you..."

"Okay," he dimly mumbles, taking hold of her neck again.

"...even if a recent study suggests repeat instances of erotic choking lead to inter-hemispheric imbalances in neuronal activation patterns..."

Calvin pales. "What?"

"...along with a reduction in the cortical complexity of the pericalcarine."

Calvin stares down at her. "...what?" He croaks again.

"Oh, sorry." She blushes. "I'm a Science major, remember?"

"Ah. Right."

"I read a lot of white papers, you know? Just for fun."

"Right..." His eyes flick. "So do you want me to choke you or...?"

"Oh, I do." She purrs, caressing his arms again. "I just want you to be informed."

"Okay." Calvin pulls back. "Cause that neuronal pattern stuff sounds pretty bad..."

"Oh don't worry about that," she assures him. "That study had a low n value and shoddy methodology."

"Right," he says. "A low n value..."

"The only thing you need to worry about..." She cups his hands and guides them back to her throat. "...is wrapping these big, strong, manly fingers tight around my dainty little neck."

"Right." Against his better judgment, Calvin goes along with it. The neuronal activation patterns in his brain, located in his upper head, tell him it's a Bad Idea. His lower head, however, asserts its God-given executive authority, overruling any quibbling objections concerning risk or safety. He is, after all, a man.

The carnal consummation resumes and in less than a minute, they're back at a desperate, crouch-creaking pace.

"Yes! Yes! YES!" Iris cries in an ever-mounting frenzy. "Choke me! Choke me so hard you'll be culpable for criminal and civil liability in a court of law!"

"Nope." Calvin's hands fly off like polarity-repelled magnets.

A panting, sweat-slick Iris looks up, dazed. "What? What's wrong?"

"What's wrong?" He repeats, incredulous. "I don't wanna go to jail, that's what's wrong!"

Iris scoffs, rolling her eyes. "You're not going to go to jail."

"What was all that stuff about criminal liability?"

"Oh you know," she shrugs. "There have been cases."

"Cases?" He squints. "Cases of what?"

"Of accidental strangulation during erotic asphyxiation," she casually clarifies.

"Come again."

"You know, like when Sam Pybus strangled Sophie Moss in the UK."

"You know the names."

"Back in 2021."

"And the 𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘴?"

Iris counts the cases on her fingers. "And then there was Jaaron Thomas in 2023, Richard Henry Patterson in 2015..."

Calvin stares down at her in abject horror.

She stops. "If it makes you feel better, the charge in criminal cases is usually a light 5 to 10. For manslaughter."

"What the f—"

"Now in tort law—"

"Why would that make me feel better?!" Calvin yelps. 

Iris shifts uncomfortably. "Okay, you're shouting and I'm feeling a little judged right now..."

"Judged?"

"It's part of my kink," she says, defensive.

"How is Tort Law part of your Kink??"

"Wow, okay, now I'm definitely being judged." Her tone turns icy. "You're kink-shaming me."

"I'm not—"

"You're just lashing out because you're insecure."

Calvin's voice rises in disbelief. "I'm insecure??"

"Yep."

"How am I insecure?!"

"Boys are always insecure when they try something new," Iris explains. "Like dancing."

"Choking is not dancing."

"Calvin."

"Nobody goes to prison for a decade if they fuck up the Shaboozey Shuffle!"

"The bar song? That's really more of a line dance."

"I don't care!"

"Calvin, Calvin, Calvin. Look at me." She cups his elbows with her hands, attempting to soothe the man. "Look."

Calvin looks. And he'd be damned if he said she wasn't the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.

"If you're worried about the technique, I can guide you."

He sighs. "Iris I don't want you to guide me, I just want—"

"It's a simple blood choke, nothing crazy."

"A blood choke," he deadpans.

"Yep." She points at her neck. "Just squeeze my carotid arteries here and here until I go nice and limp. If I don't wake up after a minute or two, feel free to slap my face." She smiles cheerfully.

"...you're serious."

"Works every time."

He shifts to get up."I don't think I can do this—"

She clenches her thighs. "Oh Calvin, please don't ruin this. We had such a wonderful night." Her splayed fingers run across his bare chest, fingernails gently grazing his goosepimpled flesh. "And I want you 𝘴𝘰 bad."

"Well..." Once again the lower head makes the call. He is, after all, a man. "Okay. But doing a blood choke sounds so—"

"It's no biggie, really. Brazilian Jujitsu guys do it all the time."

"Brazilian Jujitsu? Iris, I'm trying to nut, not compete in the UFC."

"So am I." She pouts up with puppy dog eyes. "I thought you wanted me to feel good too."

"I do, I just—"

"You say that but here we are." She glances off to the side. "I guess you're just a typical man, looking to use a girl and toss her aside, concerned with nothing but your own selfish pleasure." 

"Iris, that's not—"

A plaintive sigh escapes her soft, glistening lips. "I thought you were different."

"I am different!"

Her eyes snap back. "Are you?"

"Yes!" he protests. "And I am concerned. I'm concerned with not killing you and going to jail for the rest of my life!" 

"See?" She looks away again. "All about you."

"How is not killing you all about me??"

She puffs her cheeks. "You're choosing to ruin the moment, Calvin."

"Ruin the—I'm not the one spouting off about brain damage and true crime in the middle of—"

"You hate me." She huffs. "I get it."

"Come on, I don't hate you. I had a really nice—"

"Then prove it." She lies back. "Choke me like you hate me."

"What?"

"Show me that you genuinely care and value my pleasure as a woman by choking me like you fucking hate me."

"..."

She lifts her chin. "I'm waiting~"

Calvin takes a deep breath and exhales. He leans in and grips her neck, growling: "You're fucking crazy, you know that?" 

She giggles. "You love it."

Once more, instinct and amorous desire take hold.

"Yes, God, YES!" Iris cries. "Induce hypoxia until I have a seizure and stroke out!" 

"Iris." Calvin grits his teeth, trying to block out her manic ravings. If he could last just a little longer...

"The only thing I crave more than your cock is Memory Loss! Cognitive impairment! Permanent Motor Dysfunction!"

"Iris, I swear to God—"

"Incontinence!"

"I don't want to give you incontinence!"

"If you do it right, I'll squirt anyway!"

Calvin stops and tosses his hands up. "That's it. I can't do this! I can't, you're fucking with me, I can't—"

"Wait, wait, wait." She tightens the lock of her legs again, preventing retreat. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

"Iris, please."

"I'll be good!"

"You just said you could get a seizure!"

She bats her eyelashes. "You say that like it's a bad thing."

"It is a bad thing, Iris. Seizures are bad."

"Not all seizures."

"Yes, all seizures!" 

She levels a smouldering gaze. "An orgasm is a type of seizure."

"Iris."

"A pussy seizure."

"I'm out." Calvin pushes down in her knee. Still, she refuses to relinquish him.

"Iris, I'm serious, if you don't let me up right now I'll—"

"You can come in me."

Calvin freezes. "Huh?"

"I don't want you to pull out." She gazes up at him with naked need. "I want you to come in me, raw and hard."

"...really?" 

She bites her lip and nods."I want you to paint my walls like Bob Ross with a firehouse."

That did it. The lower head no longer needed to overrule the upper. They were now in total agreement, completely united in action and purpose. Calvin is, after all, a man.

"Come on, Big boy. I'm not even on birth contro—HgRK!"

Calvin roughly seizes her throat with both hands and buries her head in the couch cushions. "Get ready to take it all, slut!" His palms clamp her carotid arteries.

"F-finally~~" Eight seconds from blackout, spit bubbles at the corner of Iris' mouth as a look of crooked bliss washes over her mottled, purple-red face. "I always -𝙃𝙧𝙂𝙆𝙠- wanted to be -𝙐𝙍𝙂𝙠- a moth—"

Calvin sits back, panting. "Jesus, that was—" He runs a shaky hand over his face and through his damp hair.  "That was amazing!

"..."

"Iris?"

"..."

"Iris."

"..."

"Holy shit. Iris! Hey!"

"..."

"Don't do this noodle arm shit to me. Iris! Wake up!"

"..."

"Oh fuck. Oh fuck oh fuck. She's dead. She's fucking dead. She's fucking dead and I fucking killed her and I'm going to fucking jail! IRIS!"

"..."

"What do I do What do I  do What do I do uh uh uh—"

-𝐒𝐋𝐀𝐏-

"Iris!"

-𝐒𝐋𝐀𝐏- -𝐒𝐋𝐀𝐏-

"Wake up!

"...mh..."

"...Iris?"

"...a mother~♥️"

"Oh thank GOD! You scared the SHIT out of me! Are you alright?"

She bobble-head nods. Calvin kneels down beside her. "I never been more terrified in my life!"

"𝑌e𝑎h?" She grins and groggily slurs. "𝑊a𝑛n𝑎 𝑔o a𝑔a𝑖n?"
