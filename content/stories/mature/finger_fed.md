Oh. My. God. Honey! Did you see the news about the Fed?"

"What is it now—𝘏𝘐𝘊!"

"Trump is siccing the Department of Justice on Jerome Powell! Over a freaking building renovation!"

"Ah, great that's—𝘏𝘐𝘊—the last thing we need."

"Oh, sweetie. Hiccups again?"

"I can't—𝘏𝘐𝘊—help it. You know I always get the—𝘏𝘐𝘊—ups when I hear bad news about our—𝘏𝘐𝘊—national monetary policy."

"My poor little macro-minded fixed-rate fretter. Do you need me to fingerblast your ass again?"

"No, I'm just gonna—𝘏𝘐𝘊—handle it."

"But it worked last time."

"That was a—𝘏𝘐𝘊—wild fluke."

"Now honey, ChatGPT already explained to both of us that rectal digital massage stimulates the vagus nerve, sending a powerful electrochemical signal to the brain that sets off neurotransmitters, thereby overriding the involuntary reflex firing pattern afflicting the diaphragm."

"It'll—𝘏𝘐𝘊—pass."

"That's what you said when the Fed met in December and cut interest rates by 25 bps. You hiccupped for the next two weeks straight!"

"It wasn't—𝘏𝘐𝘊—that bad."

"I almost took you to the emergency room on Christmas!"

"When Trump's done the only body that's gonna need—𝘏𝘐𝘊—acute triage care around here is the—𝘏𝘐𝘊—Board of Governors."

"Well sweetie, it doesn't help to worry about things we can't control—like category 5 hurricanes or Bruno Mars releasing another tired album of lazy, reheated 1970s funk-soul pastiche."

"Hey, Smokin' Out the Window is a—𝘏𝘐𝘊—great song."

"And we both know Anderson. Paak carried it in his perfectly sculpted, diamond-bright teeth. Now bend over."

"Dear, can you not fangirl over—𝘏𝘐𝘊—beloved multi-Grammy award-winning R&B artists when you're about to—𝘏𝘐𝘊—give me the two-finger bunk-funker."

"Sorry. I'll save the breathless panegyrizing for Anderson's odontic apotheosis 'til after."

"Thank you, dear—𝘏𝘐𝘊—you know, me and Jerome Powell share at least one thing in—𝘏𝘐𝘊—common."

"What's that honey?"

"We're both getting—𝘏𝘐𝘊—ed in the 𝒂𝑨𝒂𝒉𝑯𝑯𝑯!"
