Jake plops down in front of the big screen TV. "Bro, what time is it?"

Paul plops down beside him. "It's NTR Friday bro."

"I love this shit, man. Bros being bros, watching cheating cuck porn. Together."

"Right?" Paul says. "I can't even imagine why we're forever alone."

"Yeah..."

Over on the three tier cat-tree scratching-post by the couch, Paul's overweight Bombaby, Mr. Popo, meows.

"Anyway, bro! What are we watching today?"

"Cheating Wives Taste Like White Claw-"

"Lit! Bro put that shit on." Jake claps his hands. "Put. It. On."

The bros lay back, basking in the soft glow of the 80" wall-mounted Sony Bravia.

Jake vibrates in anticipation. "She's gonna do it bro."

...𝒅𝒐𝒏'𝒕 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒚 𝒂𝒃𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝒊𝒕. 𝑰 𝒂𝒍𝒔𝒐 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝑷𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒍𝒆 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑷𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑭𝒓𝒖𝒊𝒕...

"Just wait bro," Paul says. "You don't even know."

"Here we go!"

On screen, the man whips out a thick black book and sets it on the table.

𝑰𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒃𝒆𝒈𝒊𝒏𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑾𝒐𝒓𝒅...

Jake blinks. "...what?"

... 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑾𝒐𝒓𝒅 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝑮𝒐𝒅...

"Bro, what is this shi-"

"Shh, wait." Paul holds up a finger. "This is the best part."

...𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑾𝒐𝒓𝒅 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝑮𝒐𝒅.

"And the Word was God," Paul repeats. He turns to Jake. "Lit right?"

Jake stares. "No!" he yelps. "Not lit!"

"Bro."

"Not lit at all!"

"Bro, wait-"

"We came here to watch NTR. CHEATING. CUCK. PORN." Jake points at the screen in absolute indignation. "This is NOT NTR!"

Paul laughs. "That's where you're wrong bro."

"This is some Pat Robertson 700 Club fundie shit! He's 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔 at her."

"That's the best part. She's gonna become a nun."

"A 𝒏𝒖𝒏?!"

"Yeah, you didn't let me say the full title before. The show is called Cheating Wives Taste Like White Claw Until They See the White Light of Christ and Give Their Lives to God-"

"Are you-"

"Bro, wait, hear me out."

"Are you fucking with me?"

"I read a translated interview about the mangaka. He set out to write pure NTR. Devoid of sex."

"Devoid of sex??"

"A married woman taken as a wife for God—the paragon of masculinity—and forced to live a life of endless celibacy. The Japanese are genius perverts bro."

"You're kidding."

"It's the ultimate cuckening."

On screen, the scene changes to a cathedral. The married woman now wears a full length all black habit with a white coif.

"Aw man," Jake slumps. "She's not even a 𝑠𝑒𝑥𝑦 nun."

𝑵𝒐𝒘, the man from the apartment, dressed as a priest, flings his arms wide. 𝑮𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒔𝒆𝒍𝒇 𝒕𝒐 𝑺𝒄𝒂𝒆𝒗𝒓𝒂, 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑳𝒊𝒗𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑰𝒏𝒇𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏. 

"...bro?"

A crimson sigil bleeds up through the cathedral floor, splitting open as a writhing, squamous monstrosity slithers forth, its tentacles lashing the air.

𝑻𝒂𝒌𝒆 𝒎𝒆, 𝑺𝒄𝒂𝒆𝒗𝒓𝒂! The cheating-wife-turned-nun implores. 𝑴𝒂𝒌𝒆 𝒎𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒔𝒆𝒆𝒅𝒃𝒆𝒅!

"Bro, what is ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔?!"

"Oh right," Paul says. "You still didn't let me say the full title."

"There's more?!" Jake rasps in mounting horror.

"Cheating Wives Taste Like White Claw Until They See the White Light of Christ and Give Their Lives to God, Only to be Turned into Seedbeds by Scaevra, the Ovipositing Demon."

"Ovipositing?!" Jake scrambles backwards, knocking over the cat-tree.

𝑀𝘦𝑜𝘸!

𝑶𝒉, 𝑺𝒄𝒂𝒆𝒗𝒓𝒂-𝒔𝒂𝒎𝒂! 𝑵𝒐 𝒎𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒆𝒈𝒈𝒔!

"Fuck this! I'm out of here!"
