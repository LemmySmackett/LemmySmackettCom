Hyena-Kamala Harris, smiling at the debate: "I got that dawg in me, America. And soon that dawg will be in you too!"

Trump, smug: "Tell them about the psuedo-penis, Kamala."

Hyena-Kamala: "I don't believe that's anyone's..."

Trump: "It's yuge, folks."

Hyena-Kamala: "That's really not-"

Trump: "Some are saying almost as big as mine."

Hyena-Kamala: "..."

Trump, shrugging: "I disagree."

Hyena-Kamala: "Moderator, please."

ABC Moderator: "Mr. Trump, the question was about the War in Ukraine and banal platitudes."

Trump: "And she gives birth through it."

ABC Moderator: "What?"

Trump: "Looks like a blown out car tire when she's done."

Hyena-Kamala: "How do you know that?"

Trump: "I've watched a lot of videos, believe me. Maybe more than anyone. I said, Elon, bring me all the Hyena psuedo-penis you've got."

Hyena-Kamala: "..."

ABC Moderator: "..."

Trump: "We watched it for days."
