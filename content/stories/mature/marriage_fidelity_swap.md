Hey, man. Heard you finally proposed."

"Yeah, Sherry and I have been dating for 17 years now and I feel like it's finally time to shit or get off the can."

"You always were a Romantic."

"But I gotta admit, I'm still nervous."

"Well, you can never rush these things. That's how you get hemorrhoids."

"How do I know Sherry's gonna stay faithful to me?"

"Faithful?"

"Yeah, like what if we get hitched and then she leaves me in five years for some young barrel-chested broccoli-haired prick and takes half my worth?"

"I don't know. How's she gonna stop you from having all those 1-on-1 late-night hot yoga sessions with that perky personal trainer of yours?"

"Hey, it's not a crime for a young, stunning 19-year-old blonde from some unspecified village in the Baltics to be perky, alright?"

"I'm not saying it's a crime, I'm just surprised she hasn't put an eye out."

"Tatiana is a consummate professional, and all the sweaty deep squat groaning I do with her is completely above board."

"Uh huh."

"Totally platonic." 

"Words that would put any woman at ease."

"Seriously! It's not Tatiana's fault that 11:59 PM just happens to be when I do my best workouts. I'm a hot yoga night owl. You know I've always been a hot yoga night owl."

"Well, if you're really concerned about Sherry, you could always go with a pre-nup—"

"Of course I'm gonna go with a pre-nup. What am I an idiot?"

"—and execute a marital fidelity swap with a third-party market."

"Say what?"

"It's like marriage insurance, man, simple stuff. Look, you have Sherry take out a contract on herself. She pays a small premium—ten bucks a month, something piddly—and designates you as the beneficiary."

"Okay."

"And then if she ever cheats on you, it voids the pre-nup and you receive a payout from the market."

"Wait, a payout?"

"Nothing crazy, just something to cover your costs."

"Ah."

"All of which would be documented ahead of time: moving out, counseling, childcare, etc."

"Okay. Wow, uh, I mean, it all sounds good, but how do I prove she cheated?"

"Oh, you don't have to prove anything at all."

"I don't?"

"Nah, if you could influence the outcome of the swap directly it would make you a highly correlated risk."

"Oh."

"Instead, the contract would rely on a multi-factor trigger drawing on various Sources of Truth like wearable biometrics and her personal phone while corroborating with partially de-anonimized cryptographically secure third-party metadata."

"Uh, wait, if they can partially de-anonimize the metadata, can't they fully de-anonimize it?"

"Now who would do a thing like that?"

"Okay, but this sounds pretty intense, right? Like, everything Sherry does will be tracked?"

"You say that like it's not already happening."

"It's nice to see you again, Edward Snowden. How was Siberia?"

"Yes, everything would be tracked, including her location and all communications you have between each other as a couple, including any audio recordings from any devices inside your home."

"In case she cheats there, right?" 

"Or in case you try to work with her to defraud the market."

"Oh. And what happens if they think we've defrauded the market?"

"They'd claw back the funds, ban you for life—"

"Yowza."

"—and there's a high probability of legal prosecution."

"Man, marital fidelity is serious business. I'm guessing other people also get to bet on our relationship? Friends and family?"

"Nah, it would be too easy for outsiders to influence the outcome."

"Well, at least some things are sacred."

"But you would be included as a data point for large indices."

"Indices?"

"Sure, then people can trade index volatility and bet on stuff like 'Infidelity rates among 30-40 year olds' and 'Fidelity risk correlated with ketamine consumption'."

"Not the Extraconjugal K-Hole Index."

"You see, the market maker hedges aggregate risk through anonymized indices. That preserves pricing efficiency without turning any of the individual marriages into a spectator sport. Or a shooting gallery."

"Well, this whole thing sounds completely profit-driven and wildly amoral."

"Yep."

"But I think I'm gonna do it anyway."

"Who wouldn't?"

"I have to protect the sanctity of my marriage, after all."

"And what better way to do it than prediction markets? Now mind you, Sherry will also want to protect the marriage."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, if you make her take out a fidelity swap on herself, she gonna's demand the same from you. No?"

"Oh...you think so?"

"I'd bet on it."

"Uh.

"But you've got nothing to hide. Right, night owl?"

"No, yeah, no, I'm good. Uh, circling back on the biometrics for a second—"

"Hm?"

"Since I do love doing 1-on-1 late-night hot yoga with Tatiana, I couldn't possibly sign myself up, right? All the vigorous platonic activity would cause a false positive and trigger the swap."

"Well, heightened activity late at night and away from your home would certainly be a risk indicator—"

"Phew."

"—but modern wearables utilize an advanced combination of accelerometers, IMU sensors, and gryoscopes—"

"Uh."

"— that monitor cadence and variability of heart rate, respiration patterns, and muscular activation timing. The rhythmic pelvis and torso motion consistent with sexual activity doesn't match anything like what you'd expect to see in running, swimming, or weight lifting, and as such, activity misclassifications by the wearable algorithm are exceedingly rare."

"Damn. Uh, even for—"

"Even for late-night 1-on-1 hot yoga with perky young blondes from the Baltics. Yes."

"Ah, well. It's all very interesting, but I think I'll just stick with the pre-nup."

"Oh. You sure?"

"Mhm. I'm sure."

"You can never really be sure what people are up to these days."

"That's true, that's true. But I think relationships are actually about trust. Don't you?"
