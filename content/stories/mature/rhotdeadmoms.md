"Man, people are doing some wild shit online. Jim Acosta just interviewed a dead teenage shooting victim. Everybody's posting animated AI vids of their deceased parents and grandparents."

"Uh huh."

"There's even a new subreddit called R/HotDeadMoms for God's sake!"

"Oh, that's me."

"What?"

"I mean, we're a growing community, but I've got the most popular HotDeadMom by, like, a pretty wide margin."

"Dude."

"2 million upvotes~"

"Christ."

"It's okay! I used old pics from the 70s, back when she was a young bubbly blonde in tight daisy dukes."

"That's worse!"

"How is that worse?"

"How is it 𝘯𝘰𝘵 worse?

"What am I supposed to post? AI vids of when she was all old and bedridden, crippled by pancreatic cancer?"

"You shouldn't—"

"Cause I'm not gonna post AI vids of when she was old and bedridden, crippled by pancreatic cancer. That's fucked up, dude."

"You shouldn't post anything! You shouldn't even be generating them!"

"Eh?"

"It's Harry Potter mirror shit, man. Digital Necromancy!"

"Pssh, out here acting like I'm the Lich King or somethin'. Look, here's my mom in a flowing white dress, basking in a Sylvan, sun-dappled forest."

"I don't—wow, that's life-like."

"Gorgeous, right? And here she is at Daytona Beach, flanked by five barrel-chested chads. This is also generated from a real picture."

"Uh, how popular was your mom?"

"And here's a completely bespoke generation of my mom, clad in a barely there string bikini, twerking to Megan Thee Stallion."

"What?"

~𝑩𝒐𝒅𝒚-𝒐𝒅𝒚-𝒐𝒅𝒚-𝒐𝒅𝒚-𝒐𝒅𝒚-𝒐𝒅𝒚-𝒐𝒅𝒚-𝒐𝒅𝒚~

"Bro."

~𝑩𝒐𝒅𝒚 𝒄𝒓𝒂𝒛𝒚, 𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒗𝒚, 𝒘𝒂𝒗𝒚, 𝒃𝒊𝒈 𝒕𝒊𝒕𝒕𝒊𝒆𝒔, 𝒍𝒊𝒍' 𝒘𝒂𝒊𝒔𝒕 (𝒎𝒘𝒂𝒉)~

"Crazy right? This one just passed 300k."

"Man, I don't even—"

"'Course upvotes don't mean anything if we don't get Conversions."

"Conversions?"

"To the OnlyFans account."

"Get the fuck out of here."

"I'm serious! Our basic 'Good Boy' tier starts at $10/month and grants subscribers access to all generated pictures and videos."

"This is the worst thing I've ever seen."

"Our $20/month 'Momma's Favorite' tier grants access to everything in the previous tier and access to her LLM-Managed DMs. Naturally, we charge extra per message."

"Naturally?"

"And our premium $50/month 'Golden Son' tier lets the subscriber enter a dynamically generated 3d world once a month to go on a salacious 24-hour date—with my mom."

"You're serious?"

"To the tune of $650k a month, yes. Quite serious."

"You're really whoring out your dead mother. On OnlyFans."

"Whoring is a harsh word, isn't it? I'm simply allowing her to posthumously participate in the long-tail post-mortem para-social creator economy."

"You know you're going to hell, right?"

"Maybe. But to be fair, a lot of our competition is already there."

"Because other people are also digitally pimping out their dead moms?"

"Sure, but I was actually thinking about the living competition. Well, recently living."

"Recently living?"

"So it's hard for your average bubbly blonde teen to make a name for herself in the Age of the Necrotic Erotic, right?"

"...I guess?"

"So they take a ton of pictures and videos for future AI Gens and off themselves for the publicity bump."

"Jesus."

"It's like SuicideGirls but with actual SuicideGirls."
