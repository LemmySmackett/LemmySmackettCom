“Hey bro, can I use your computer real quick? I need to ask ChatGPT something."

“What? Don’t you have a phone?”

“Yeah, but AI companies track every word you type, the government legally requires them to retain every message you send, and the AI itself automatically and continuously scans and cross-references your entire conversation backlog of embarrassing and potentially reputation-destroying queries to detect and report any criminal offenses—or probable intent to commit criminal offenses—to the Feds, state, and/or local authorities.”

“What?”

“Depending on jurisdiction, of course."

“That’s not true.”

“Okay, so you don’t mind if I—”

“Nope!”

“Come on, man. I just need to ask ChatGPT what a good synonym for callipygian is.”

“Ugh, fine. Make it quick.”

“Thanks. Oh hey, you’re getting ads.”

“Ads?”

“Yeah, I heard about this. The free tier gets ads now. They’re targeted based on your conversation history.”

“Uh, maybe you should—”

“First ad: striped pink knee socks. They look nice. What were you—”

“My sister!”

“Huh?”

“Those are for my sister.”

“Ah. You know, that muscle mommy mamacita could definitely rock these.”

“Hey.”

“I’m serious! Ever since that lean beef baddie started hitting the gym, I’ve dreamed bi-nightly of her supple, iron-thewed thighs cracking my skull like a softly rotting cantaloupe.”

“Bro.”

“Second ad:—"

"Wait, is bi-nightly twice a night or every other night?"

"—a matching string bikini for the knee socks.”

“Uh, still for my sister?”

“Checks out. Nothing more wholesome than loving siblings buying barely-there beachwear for each other.”

“Haha, yeah. So if you could just log out—”

“Third ad: a giant, fully-enclosed cartoon fox mask for the low, low price of…wow."

"Uh."

"Damn, bro."

“Uuuh.”

“$2000??”

“I’m…shopping early for Halloween?”

“I don’t blame you. With prices this high, you gotta keep an eye out for off-season deals.”

“Right, yeah, hey! You said you needed a synonym for a word, right?”

“Uh-huh. Callipygian.”

“Right, so let’s just go grab a thesaurus, which is an air-gapped stack of bound paper sheets not tied to any of my—”

“Hold on. Last ad.”

“Wait!”

“A 16” Bad Dragon Roko’s Basilisk Booty-Breaker."

“Ah, fuck.”

“Dude.”

“I—”

“𝘋𝘶𝘥𝘦.”

“Listen, it’s not—”

“Your sister is a 𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙠!”
