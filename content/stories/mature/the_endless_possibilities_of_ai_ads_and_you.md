Hey bro, can I use your computer real quick? I need to ask ChatGPT something."

"What? Don't you have a phone?"

"Yeah, but OpenAI tracks every word you type, the government legally requires them to keep every question you ask, and the AI automatically scans and cross-references the conversation backlog to detect and report any criminal offenses—or probable intent to commit criminal offenses—to the Feds and local authorities."

"What? Okay, now I definitely don't want you on my computer. Get—"

"Come on, man. I just need to ask ChatGPT what a good synonym for callipygian is."

"Ugh, fine. Make it quick."

"Thanks. Oh, hey, you're getting ads." 

"Ads?"

"Yeah, I heard about this. The free tier gets ads now. They're hyper-targeted based on your conversation history."

"Uh, maybe you should—"

"First ad: striped pink knee socks. They look nice enough. What were you—"

"My sister!"

"Huh?"

"Those are for my sister."

"Aah. You know, she could definitely rock these."

"Hey."

"I'm serious! Ever since she started hitting the gym, I've dreamed bi-nightly of her supple, iron-thewed thighs cracking my skull like a cantaloupe."

"Bro."

"Second ad: a matching string bikini for the knee socks."

"Haha, yeah. So if you could just log out—"

"Third ad: a giant, fully-enclosed cartoon fox mask for the low, low price of...wow bro, damn."

"Uuuh."

"$600?"

"I'm...shopping early for Halloween?"

"I don't blame you. With prices this high, you gotta keep an eye out for off-season deals."

"Right, yeah, hey! You said you needed a synonym for a word, right?"

"Uh-huh. Callipygian."

"Right, so let's just go grab a thesaurus, which is not tied to my—"

"Hold on. Last ad."

"Wait!"

"A 16" Bad Dragon Roko's Basilisk BootyBreaker."

"Ah, fuck."

"Dude."

"I—"

"𝘋𝘶𝘥𝘦."

"Listen, it's not—"

"Your sister is a 𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙠!"
