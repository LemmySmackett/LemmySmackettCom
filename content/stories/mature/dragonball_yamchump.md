Okay, Krillin. Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Goten, Piccolo, regular Trunks, Future Trunks, Buu, and Oolong—"

"Why the hell did we bring Oolong?"

"—have all been defeated. It's up to you and you alone to defeat Perfect Emperor Rainbow Slay Queen Fuschia Freeza and save the day."

"What? You're here too, Yamcha!"

"Oh no. I'm not here to fight. I'm just here to offer moral support—"

"Oh yeah, I feel 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭 supported right now."

"—to Vegeta."

"What?"

"It's the only way Bulma will let me watch."

"...watch what?"

"You know."

"..."

"When they have date night at the Hyatt?"

"The years keep rolling by and you just find more ways to disappoint us all. Don't you, buddy?"

"There's nobody I could disappoint more than myself."

"God might disagree."

"Or Puar."

"Yeah? How is the little shape-shifting furball these days?"

"She's good. Usually, she turns into the chair."
