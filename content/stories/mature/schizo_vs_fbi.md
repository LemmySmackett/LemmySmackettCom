On a sunny Tuesday afternoon, Ronald Tweetwright answers the dilapidated front door of his luxury $4000/month 350 sq ft single-occupant duplex and finds himself face-to-face with a federal agent.

"Agent Kessler. FBI." Clad in Ray-Ban aviators and tan chino shorts, the government goon flashes the badge hanging from his yellow lanyard. "Are you Ronald Tweetright?"

"I am," Ronald cooly states.

"You're very calm for a man with a federal agent on his front porch, Ronald."

Ronald shrugs. "I'm always talking to federal agents. You just pretend you're not listening.

"Right. You're coming with us."

"Oh? The cuffs already?" Ronald smirks. "What's the charge?"

"No charge." A second agent walks up holding a straitjacket. "And no handcuffs. We're taking you in for your own safety."

"Oh, are you?" Ronald chuckles. "It hasn't even been a week since the feds brought back the insane asylums and you're already abducting dissidents, huh? It's nice to know I'm a high-value target. Tell me, do you guys pay for my full Snubstack or just stick to the free articles?"

"You're not high value, Ronald," the second agent says. "You're just nuts."

"Oh yeah? Prove it."

Kessler sighs. "Online you go by the handle..." He checks the page in his hand. "@/SchizoMoeNihilist"

"What? It's illegal to have a joke handle now?"

"You've posted about your struggles with schizophrenia and 'weapons-grade autism' over 10,000 times."

Ronald shrugs. "I have a lot of piercing, meta-ironic insights about society and the human condition, rooted in an encyclopedic command of history, philosophy, and slice-of-life anime. "

"You've also posted 56,471 times that you are, and this is verbatim, fully retarded."

"Just some old-fashioned shit-posting with friends."

"You have 3 followers, all bots, and none of your 193,000 tweets has ever gotten a retweet or like because you've been shadow-banned for—" Kessler checks his notes. "Fourteen years."

"Damn," Ronald frowns. "I knew Jack was hiding my bangers, but even Elon?"

"Your account is filled with incoherent ramblings that a meth addict would be ashamed to scream while shitting butt naked in an Arby's booth."

"Such as?"

Kessler clears his throat and reads the tweets out. "The Longhouse isn't matriarchy. It’s post-sexual bureaucracy and HR-led Kumbaya Circles. That's why there are no stallions in My Little Pony."

Ronald nods. "Friendship isn't magic. It's castration."

The agent reads on: "Cute Girls Doing Cute Things is the Final Configuration before societal heat death. Desire flattened. Narrative erased. Cuteness as entropy."

"It's true. The girls from Lucky Star are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. "

"That 2d foid isn’t your waifu—she’s hospice care for a dying species. The Longhouse made kawaii."

"Indisputable really."

"Moe-nihilism is realizing the world ended, and all that’s left is watching girls in sailor uniforms do club activities while entropy ticks down."

"By the way have you seen Girls' Last Tour? Great show."

"Moe is the opiate for a world that no longer believes in anything except staying soft until it disappears."

"I fail to see how any of these are objectionable." 

Kessler sighs. "Sonic is Ted K coded. And that's good."

"That one's obvious, right? You don't even have to get Straussian with it."

The agent reads the last tweet:
"Taika Waititi's Akira could have worked."

"...what?"

"Taika Waititi's Akira could have worked," the Agent repeats.

"And?"

"And nothing. That's the tweet."

"Give me that!" Ronald snatches the paper out of his hand and stares at it. A simple tweet. Six words.

"No," he mumbles, shaking his head. "There has to be more. A follow-up where I suggest the possibility of a reading based on Heideggerian BioTech-fetishism! O-or a thread on how the adaptation would be rooted in Girard's treatment of telos in light of mimetic desire!"

"Nope." The agent taps the page. "It's just a standalone tweet that says—"

"Taika Waititi's Akira could've worked." The words are strange and bitter on Ronald's tongue. The page quivers in his trembling hands. "When did I post this?"

"Timestamps right there," Kessler says. "August 7, 2023. One minute after midnight."

Ronald's throat runs dry. "A whole year after Thor: Love and Thunder came out."

"Yeah."

Roy drops the paper and turns to the second agent. "Alright put me in the jacket." He holds his arms out. 

The agent blinks. "Really?"

"Yeah man, I'm fuckin' nuts."
