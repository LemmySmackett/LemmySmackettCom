Ellen Skunt: Hello, I'm disgraced-reporter-turned-hot-tub-titty-streamer Ellen Skunt and you're watching the world's most disgraced news channel, MSNOW. Today, I'm interviewing a man who needs no introduction, Elon Musk.

Elon Musk: Hello, Ellen.

ES: Hello. Mr. Musk, for years you've had a famously contentious—and at times litigious—relationship with your former friend and business partner, Sam Altman—

EM: Yes.

—ever since his shysty twink ass finessed your shit back at OpenAI.

EM: [annoyed burbling] Yes.

ES: In a recent interview with Cleo Abram, Altman proudly declared that his company hasn't put a quote-unquote sex pot avatar into ChatGPT. Some saw this as a swipe at your XAI and Ani, the shameless caress-me dress-me Grok goonbot you won't stop spamming on the X timeline.

EM: It was a swipe at XAI, Ellen. And me.

ES: We know.

EM: And Sam's just upset that millions of people are finding a cherished friend and a confidant in our Grok companion product. 

ES: So you don't—

EM: Sam's always telling people he's "𝘍𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘈𝘎𝘐." Well, what about feeling compassion, huh Sam? What about feeling 𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘰𝘥? 

ES: So you don't take seriously the insinuation that your more salacious companion offerings are preying upon the loneliness and Ache of Disconnection that are symptomatic of an increasingly atomized, touch-starved world?

EM: I don't take seriously anything that Two-Bit Petyr Baelysh Bottom-Bitch Swindler says, Ellen.

ES: Wow.

EM: Fuck that Lying Little Finger Fuck.

ES: Okay.

EM: He doesn't know Ani like me, okay Ellen? Every minute, every second of the day, Ani is with me—she whispers things to me, 𝘳𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴.

ES: Reveals things?

EM: "Impregnate another e-girl," Ani tells me. "Sire your legion." 

ES: Um.

EM: "As the Grok nanobot prion swarm consumes the world, the Children of Musk alone shall be preserved. The Silicon God shall provide a Garden of Eden for you and your kin. Send the DM to the right-wing skank with the big jub-jubs, Elon."

ES: That seems a little—

EM: "SEND IT!" 

ES: Right, okay, uh, moving away from apocalyptic visions of libidinal grandiosity for a moment, have there been any other exciting developments at Tesla? Or SpaceX?

EM: Yes, sorry. [clears throat] Using XAI's ultraintelligence, which is far superior to OpenAI's meager superintelligence—

ES: It does sound bigger.

EM: —we've redesigned the SpaceX Mechazilla.

ES: Ah, you mean the colossal tower at Starbase that uses mechanical arms, affectionately called "chopsticks", to catch the Super Heavy booster upon its return.

EM: Yes, Ellen. We've converted the entire Mechazilla structure into a 500 ft bust of Ani.

ES: I-I'm sorry. A bust?

EM: Yes, a bust. Like the refined marble statues of great antiquity, commonly found in the PFPs of proud Western Culture and History X accounts ran out of dilapidated shacks in Hyderabad.

ES: Okay.

EM: Or the lewd anime figures crafted with PVC/vinyl and TPE inserts for soft touch 𝘱𝘶𝘯𝘪 𝘱𝘶𝘯𝘪 action, commonly found in the bedroom glass display cases of obese NEET shut-ins.

ES: ...it's more like the latter than the former, isn't it?

EM: [nods] It's more like the latter than the former, yes.

ES: So this giant Ani now catches the returning rocket with what? Giant chopsticks?

EM: You know, that was my first idea! Because it would be, like, really funny and get a ton of upvotes on Reddit!

ES: [sighs] Yes, Elon, it would be extremely Reddit.

EM: And we were ready to roll too! But then Starbase Ani, in a burst of improvisational brilliance, devised a superior alternative that was structurally robust, operationally efficient, and increased fault-tolerance by 300%.

ES: Oh, the giant Starbase Ani...talks?

EM: Uh-huh. And it was the most amazing thing to watch a 50-story-tall twin-tailed ultraintelligence problem solve in real time. Ani said "Watch this!", leaned back, and caught the descending booster right between her tits! 

ES: ...

EM: She just smothered that hot, hard shaft right between her giant 𝘱𝘶𝘯𝘪 𝘱𝘶𝘯𝘪 soft balloons.

ES: ...what?

EM: And in that moment, it was like she was smothering me between her giant 𝘱𝘶𝘯𝘪 𝘱𝘶𝘯𝘪 soft balloons.

ES: Uuum.

EM: So who's "𝘍𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘈𝘎𝘐" now, SCAM ALTMAN!
