The Xeno-maid perched on the weathered rock, holding her silent vigil. Her beloved, a handsome prince, lay on the shore, seafoam waves lapping against his unconscious body. Mercifully, he had survived the battle with the Cecaelian sea witch. And yet there remained an impassible chasm between these two would-be lovers: for he was a human male who walked flat-footed on plantigrade legs and she was an endoparasitoid extraterrestrial with a wide caudal fin.

Nearby in the tranquil waters, her adoptive father, King Triton, and his dutiful advisor, Sebastian, watched.

"She really does love him." The King lamented. "Doesn't she, Sebastian?"

The crab nodded. "Well, it's like I always say, your highness: children got to be free to lead their own lives."

"You always say that?" The King shot the crab an incredulous look.

Sebastian shrugged, holding up his claws with a sheepish grin.

The King sighed. "Well, I guess there's just one problem left."

"What's that, your highness?"

"How much I'm going to miss her."

King Triton lifted his magic trident and aimed the pointed tines at the young girl for whom he had done and would do anything. Wisps of shimmering golden light weaved through the waves and embraced the Xeno-maid, illuminating her segmented, biomechanical flesh.

A moment later, the prince roused to an enchanting vision. The Xeno-maid emerged from the waters, arms held wide, walking upright like a lycan, on a pair of slender, digitigrade legs. The prince rushed to his beloved, who towered over him at a daunting eight feet.

Starcrossed, their eager mouths met.

The prince gagged as the Xeno-maid's hard proboscis jutted into the depth of his throat. His arms, pinned at his sides, twitched and spasmed as egg after egg pushed through the appendage and deposited into his digestive tract. Unable to seize a single breath, his lungs burned. His eyes rolled. His body soon went limp, claimed by unconsciousness once more.

His willing flesh would prove a glorious seedbed, the first of many in the tide to come.

"It's a beautiful thing, your highness." Sebastian sniffed, wiping a tear from his eyes. "A beautiful thing." Î© [^1]
