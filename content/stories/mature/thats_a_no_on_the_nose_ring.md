Out past Drover's mill, over the old stone bridge, stands the Byre's Regret Inn. In the dim, lamp-lit interior, two hulking minotaurs sit at the bar, nursing tankards of Tough Buck Bourbon.

"So you get that labyrinth gig?" Brannok Sablemane asks.

"Man, I went down to the palace, for the interview?" Goremor the Grimhorn replies. "Total dream job."

"Yeah?"

"Oh, it was beautiful. A maze you could get lost in for days—just a full-blown multicursal mire that would make that dick Daedalus weep—and bennies that were off the hoof."

"No shit."

"I'm talkin' comprehensive horn care, free salt licks in the break room, and unlimited grazing breaks." 

"That's great man. I'm glad you finally got out of the arena."

"Well..."

"If you've gored one gussed-up git in a funny hat and red cape, you've gored them all."

"I didn't take it."

"What?"

"I didn't take it."

"Dude. You said it was your dream job!"

"It was. It is. But they wanted me to wear the ring."

"The ring?"

"You know. The nose ring."

"No."

"Yeah."

"Really?"

"They said it was part of the dress code for the position. Non-negotiable."

"A fat load of prairie pies that. What else was part of this so-called dress code?"

"Nothing."

"Nothing? So you could show up in a Ralph Lauren polo, Dockers chinos, and—"

"No, not nothing-anything. Nothing-nothing."

"Oh, you mean like—"

"Balls out. Full Bull Frontal."

"Damn. They do it freaky."

"Mhm."

"You sure this labyrinth isn't secretly sponsored by kink dot com?"

"I know some hot heifers who wish it was."

"I just don't know how they can ask you to do that. Like how it's legal."

"Humans say the nose ring makes us look intimidating but—"

"It's for chains. For livestock!"

"Yeah. And like what am I, some e-thot in raccoon eyeliner and torn fishnets who can't cover rent with her failing OnlyFans?"

"You'd get more respect if you were a fat pair of daddy-issue udders wrapped in a thrifted denim jacket."

"Tauros above, it makes me sick."

"I'm saying, the ring just shouldn't be legal man. It's practically employer-mandated BDSM."

"And they just kept pushing it and I was snortin', seeing red. Hoof to God, I was mad."

"I bet it."

"So you know what I told 'em?"

"What?"

"I said, sure, I'll wear that ring, just as soon as the king here puts on a couple nipple clamps." 

"You didn't."

"I did. Hoof to God."

"I doubt they liked that."

"Oh, the royal guard wanted to fight; I said, 'Do it, pink-skin. Charge me. I want you to charge me.'"

"Right."

"Be my little China shop, bitch."

"And he wasn't ready for all that flank."

"He wasn't. Buncha soft ass tenderloins."

"Well, hey. I'm glad you stood up for yourself." Brannok raises his drink.

"Yeah." Goremor raises his own. 

"We may be half-man, half-bull monstrosities, but we have our dignity."

The pair knock their tankards together. CLINK!

"Yeah, it sucks 'cause I really wanted the gig but, eh, it is what it is."

"There's always another rodeo."

"Yeah, yeah. Hey, speaking of rodeos, you still killin' clowns or—"

"Oh no, I got out of all that."

"Cool. Cool."

"I finally got hired over at Horned Glory Ranch & Creamery."

"Oh, wow. That's the, uh, minotaur milking farm, ain't it?"

"Yep."

"With all the busty blonde milkmaids."

"Yep."

"You lucky bovine bastard. What's that like?"

"Honestly? I love showing up to work every morning—"

"I bet."

"But I'm utterly drained by the end of the day."
