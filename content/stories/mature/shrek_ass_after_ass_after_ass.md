Shrek, you gotta help me!"

"Ugh. What is it now, Donkey?"

"I slept with a dragon!"

"Oh, I know, believe me. Your beloved dronkeys, Peanut and Parfait, pissed all over Fiona's swamp petunias again." 

"No! A different dragon!"

"Donkey! You cheated on your wife?!"

"It's not—"

"Again??"

"You can't blame me! I've got animal magnetism! You 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸 I've got animal magnetism!"

"I'll say. Fifteen years of marriage and you've chased every piece of four-legged fairy-tail in this enchanted land."

"Shrek."

"How many times have I caught you braying your brains out, ass deep in ass?"

"Shrek, please."

"Just having a hee-haw time bucking the night away in chimera cheeks, bäckahäst backside, wyvern wagon—"

"Shrek, this is different."

"—hippogriff hinney, kelpie kiester, basilisk badonkadonk—"

"SHREK!"

"Why I even once caught you clappin' centaur cake."

"That's what I'm trying to tell you, Shrek! This is worse than the centaur!"

"My God, donkey. What could be worse than the centaur?"

"This dragon—"

"She was a blonde!"

[Donkey cringe-grins]

"Donkey, no."

"I didn't know!"

"Not another half-human! For Pete's sake, donkey. Your wife burned down the South Kingdom last time!"

"I know."

"Nine villages!"

"I know, I know. But she wasn't blonde when I met her, okay? She was a serpent dragon."

"Donkey. You're getting Chinese with it?"

"No!"

"Going long in a shenlong?"

"I thought she was Chinese too, at first, but it turns out she's an Aztec serpent dragon that turns into a big titty baddie."

"A blonde Latina! Oh Donkey, you've really stepped in it now."

"I know—Look! Dragon will be here any minute. You gotta hide me. Quick, bury me under your outhouse."

"Donkey, you're gonna have to face this. Like a man."

"But I'm not a man! I'm just an insatiable ass!"

"Even so, you'll have to talk it through, as a couple."

"Shrek."

"Look at it this way: at least you didn't sleep with her human form."

"Uuuh."

"You didn't sleep with her human form...did you, Donkey?"

[Donkey cringe-grins]

"Bloody hell."

"That's her! I can hear the fury in wings! They only beat like that when she's gonna beat my brains out! Hide me, Shrek, please hide me!"

"Oh, you've got bigger problems than a rage-addled wyrm-wife who can level kingdoms, Donkey."

"Bigger problems?? What problems?!!"

"You're going to hell, Donkey."
