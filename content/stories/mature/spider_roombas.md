"BARRICADE THE DOOR!"

"What?"

"We gotta grab everything we can and put it between us and the chthonic arachnean nightmare that's prowling the hallway!"

"You gotta knock first, bro. I just got done jorkin'."

"Eugh. Did you sanitize your hands?"

"Does a bear shit in the pope's hat?"

"Okay."

"I got the 2-liter Purell pump and the 1-gallon refill bottle right here, bro."

"Great, good, now quick! Grab your mattress, your computer desk, your 8-foot-wide anime figurine display case—

"Dude, what are you—"

"—your 1/8th scale PVC/ABS lewd naughty nun figurines, your 1/6th scale PVC/ABS horny hucow figurines, your 1/4th scale PVC/ABS reverse bunnygirl figurines with exclusive soft-touch Puni-Puni action —"

"Now hold on."

"—and your $700 dakimakura body pillow with the custom onahole insert."

"You are NOT touching Bunny-Nun MooMoo-chan! That's my wife!"

"Yeah, you and every other neckbeard schlub who pulls her 3★ garbage in Harvest of the Divine Harem: Buns, Nuns, and Udders for Fun."

"You bastard—"

"And you ain't gonna be jorkin' over no trash pulls in any Gachas anyhow when that thing outside gets in here and kills us!"

"When what gets in here and kills us? What are you on about?"

"The spider, man! The—"

"Oh, come on. What are you, an arachnophobe?"

"I'm not an arachnophobe, it's—"

"'Cause arachnophobia's gotta be the most cringe phobia, bro. I'm sorry, by far, the cringest."

"Would you just—"

"Except for like, I don't know, podophilephobia."

"Pedo-what now?"

"You know, fear of foot-lovers."

"Oh. Thought you were going full Epstein on me."

"Why? He didn't like feet?"

"Actually, Jeffrey Edward Epstein was a consummate connoisseur of—never mind that!"

"Damn, now we'll never know."

"There's a freaky ass robot spider out in the hallway!"

"Robot spider?"

"Yeah man, it's all sleek gleaming metal Hideo Kojima type-shit."

"Uh, how big is it?"

"It's like the size of fuckin' grapefruit dude."

"Ah yeah. That's the control unit."

"Control unit? Wait, you own that thing?"

"Yeah, I call him Crispin."

"Huh?"

"You know, like the Thin Man? From the 2000 Charlie's Angels?"

"Man, forget Charlie's Angels!"

"Forget Charlie's Angels? That's like asking me to forget the Sistine Chapel."

"That thing leapt out of the shadows and scared the shit out of me!"

"Actually Crispin is designed to stay 𝘪𝘯 the shadows and only come out when we turn off the lights. Like a real spider."

"What the fuck? Why?"

"For the same reason real spiders do: he's pest control."

"Pest control?"

"Sure, you know: bugs, vermin, even rodents. Initially, I got him for a rat infestation in the garage. I deployed him at night, and the next morning I came out to find a pyramid of dead rats stacked knee high in my driveway."

"Jesus."

"That's nothing. One time, a hummingbird got loose in here, and I couldn't get him out. So I set Crispin to Day Mode, and you know what happened?"

"What?"

"He immediately flung himself across the room, snatched the zippy little nit right out of the air, and tore its head clean off."

"Christ, dude. You bought a hyper-lethal eight-legged autonomous assassin and let it loose in your 𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘦?"

"Oh yeah. It even comes with a home defense mode."

"If Uncle Ted could see us now."

"The demo videos are like something straight out of Evil Dead. I sleep like a baby."

"Sorry, I would never let one of those things anywhere near me, let alone 𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦 with me."

"Or those more than one."

"Say what?"

"Like I said, Crispin is the control unit. The swarm are all dime-sized."

"The 𝘴𝘸𝘢𝘳𝘮?"

"Yeah, like regular spiders. They hide in the walls, behind the furniture, under all the appliances—"

"Eugh."

"—and they only come out when it's dark. They're like an army of roach-eating Roombas."

"I gotta get out of this house. Like right now."

"What? Why? They're not gonna hurt you."

"Are you kidding me?"

"Actually I have some of the little guys programmed to just surround my bed at night and watch me as I sleep."

"..."

"You know, to make sure no real spiders crawl into my mouth."

"First off, that's an urban legend. Secondly, you're insane. I'd rather risk it with real spiders than put up with this Black Mirror Creepshow shit."

"Yech! Real spiders freak me out."

"What? You just said arachnophobia's cringe!"

"It is, bro, but have you ever seen a real spider crawl around? Blech."
