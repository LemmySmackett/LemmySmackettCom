Spider-man swings across the New York City skyline, holding his phone out.

"Hey chat, ol' webhead here. Your friendly neighborhood streamer. How's the Spider-Nation doing tonight?"

>**KingPeen:** 🕷️🕷️🕷️  
>**ImGonnaMorb:** 🕷️🕷️🕷️  
>**SpectacularSkeetSlinger:** my wife just left me  

"Oof, that's tough, SkeetSlinger. As someone who once sold his marriage to Satan and just got back with MJ, all I can say is: hang in there, buddy. Miracles do happen."

>**SpectacularSkeetSlinger:** thanks spidey. Your stream is the only thing that gets me through the day  
>**BlackCatBootyBlaster:** he's so inspiring  
>**ImGonnaMorb:** spider-bros strong together 🕷️♥️  

"Anyway gang, since MJ is in Paris for Fashion Week, we have all night to patrol the-wait!" The Web-Slinger whips his head. "My spider-sense is tingling."

>**DocKockBlock:** here we go  

Spider-Man scans the horizon and aims the camera down. "It's coming from that alleyway. We might have our first supervillain of the night, True Believers!"

>**DocKockBlock:** Save the day, Spidey!  
>**ImGonnaMorb:** LFG! 🕷️🕷️🕷️  
>**KingPeen:** 🕷️🕷️🕷️  

Spider-Man swings down and lands in the alleyway. Fifteen feet away, on the opposite side of a chest-high dumpster, a man is slumped against a brick wall.

Spider-Man approaches cautiously. "Hey Pal, you doin' okay? You're not looking to-"

"Oooh Gaaaww-Jesus!" The man startles.

Spider-Man tilts his head. "...Harry?" 

>**NoNutNaruto:*" Who TF is Harry?  
>**ImGonnaMorb:** Green Goblin's son  
>**DocKockBlock:** ******* tourist  

"P-Peter." Sweat cascades from Harry's brow. "W-what are you doing here?"

Spider-Man creeps forward with his hands up. "I could ask you the same thing, buddy."

"Peter, don't!" Harry holds up a hand. "Don't get any closer!"

>**ImGonnaMorb:** Watch out Spidey 😱  
>**KingPeen:** that MFer back on the goblin gas fr  
>**KravenThePAWGHunter:** no doubt  

"Listen, Harry. We can get you help."

"No, Peter." Harry groans. "You're the one that needs help." He pushes the back of his against the wall. "Gooood, I'm a bad friend."

"Nonsense, Harry. You've always been good to me and-"

A redhead stands up from behind the dumpster and wipes her lips.

Spider-Man freezes. "MJ?"

>**BugLover2011:** why's she got web on her chin  
>**KingPeen:** that ain't web little bro  
>**ImGonnaMorb:** 💀💀💀  

"MJ," Spider-Man's voice breaks. "Why are you..."

"I'm leaving you, Peter."

>**KingPeen:** spider-cuck 💀  
>**BallCrawler:** chat, is this real?  
>**SpectacularSkeetSlinger:** I'm getting my gun
