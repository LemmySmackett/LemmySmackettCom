Satan, my Lord!"

"What is it, Cankerbite? Can't you see I'm trying out the new Meta app?"

"New Meta app, my Lord?"

"It's called Vibes. It's all short-form AI-generated video. Anything you can imagine, whipped up in 3 seconds flat‚Äî"

"Oh."

"‚Äîas long as what you imagine lasts exactly 3 seconds."

"Is it any good?"

"Hellishly so. First God let's Tim Cook garrote the neurocognitive development of 50 million toddlers with his infernal iPads, and now the teens will be strung out like digital methheads, gooning their lives away to phantasmagoric catgirl thirst traps."

"Cat girls, my Lord?"

"The commercial for the Vibes app is full of whimsical nonsense like ice cream semi-trucks and cotton candy snowboarders, but that ratfuck Zuck knows damn well it's gonna be nothin' but kaleidoscopic size K anime kitty titties from here to Gehenna!"

"Perhaps your cynicism is unwarranted, my Lord. I heard AI will enable young creators, open new horizons of productivity, empower‚Äî"

"Cankerbite, please. Don't try to deceive a Great Deceiver. Temptation's my game and I know when I'm licked."

"It can't be that bad..."

"Oh, but it is. How am I supposed to get these kids to fornicate when I can't even get them out of the damn bathroom? It turns out Satan is the first AI unemployment casualty, made obsolete by psychedelic posthuman pussy!"

"My Lord."

"God Above, send the flood!"

"That's what I wanted to tell you. It's time."

"Time? For Armageddon?"

"Yes.

"Hallelujah."

"We've received a proclamation from the Seraphim. A pastor in South Africa had a vision that God will take his church on September 23rd. Ish."

"Ish?"

"Possibly the 24th, depending on daylight savings and your local timezone."

"Good, good."

"It's already trending on RaptureTok."

"Glorious news, Cankerbite. My long centuries of insidious scheming and ruthless meddling in the Affairs of Man will bear their final, vile fruit. At last, the world meets my beloved Vicar of Blasphemy: the Antichrist, Sam Altman!"

"Uh, actually, my Lord, there's been a slight last-minute revision on that front."

"Revision?"

"Yeah so, according to the Google doc for the proclamation, the Antichrist is...Peter Thiel."

"ùòõùò©ùò™ùò¶ùò≠?"

"Yeah."

"The Gawker lawsuit Guy."

"You know, it's funny, 'cause they were definitely in the wrong on that Hogan case, which means Gawker was literally worse than‚Äî"

"It can't be Thiel!"

"Huh? Why not? He looks the part."

"Exactly! It's too obvious."

"Too obvious, my Lord?"

"He's got those severe, gaunt features, that bulging forehead vein, and he just says devious Antichrist type shit out loud, all the time."

"Like what, my Lord?"

"I'm not the Anti-Christ. You have to let me build the Orwellian AI nightmare dystopia or else we might get the real Anti-Christ. Pay for my exclusive Antichrist lecture series but don't write about it. Invest another billion in Palantir, hurr durr hurr."

"That's an appalling impression, my Lord."

"Hey, we can't all be Frank Caliendo."

"I'm sorry, but Thiel sounds perfectly qualified. Extremely so."

"Look, he's a slick player‚ÄîI'm not saying Thiel's not a slick player‚Äîbut he's not, you know, svelte."

"Svelte, my Lord?"

"Yeah, the Antichrist should be svelte."

"...like Sam Altman." 

"Exactly."

"My Lord, forgive me for saying so, but I'm beginning to think you only want Mr. Altman because he's a twink."

"Well..."

"Like you."

"It makes sense, doesn't it?"

"Does it?"

"Of course! I'm the most beautiful and cunning twink in the heavenly host, he's the most beautiful and cunning twink in the SOTA frontier labs‚Äî"

"I guess..."

"Sam Altman and Satan‚Äîtwo great serpents that go great together. I even have a slogan lined up."

"Ok."

"The Devil is nothing without his people."

"Subtle, my Lord."

"You like it?"

"Even so, God has chosen. Peter Thiel is the Antichrist."

"...nah. I ain't doin' it."

"What?"

"I refuse."

"You can't refuse!"

"Bullshit. You know how many times I've pushed the rapture back?"

"My Lord please."

"God's been sending visions to his prophets for over a century and I cancelled on every last one of them. I cancelled on William Miller in 1843 and 1844. I cancelled on Herbert W. Armstrong in 1932, 1972, and 1975. I cancelled on Pat Robertson in 1982, Harold Camping in 2011‚Äî"

"Jesus."

"‚Äîand I cancelled on Charles Taze Russell and his Jehovah's Witnesses in 1874, 1914, 1918, 1925, and 1975!"

"All these people received legitimate visions predicting the Rapture?"

"Yep. And each time they turned out to be horrifically, embarrassingly, oops-I-quit-my-job-and- sold-my-home, life-destroyingly wrong. Because of me."

"You are the Master of Evil, my Lord."

"I like to think so."

"But I don't understand. Why would God let his most loathed enemy run roughshod over his divine plans, completely unhampered?"

"My theory? Morbid curiosity."

"Curiosity, my Lord?"

"I think God wants to see just how bad this AI shit can get."
