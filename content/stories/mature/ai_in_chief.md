I can't believe it, Martha."

"What's that, Henry?"

"That son of a bitch Donald Trump won again!"

"Oh? Did we have another election already? What year is it?"

"2052, you fat-bottomed fossilized foid."

"Henry."

"My little arthritic ass-clapper."

"Save it for the bedroom, Henry."

"But seriously, 52nd President of the United States! Unreal."

"Well, at least we still have democracy."

"Democracy. Ha."

"Did we get the (R) version or the (D) version this time?"

"(D). (R) won back in 2048."

"That's good. I like that they go back and forth now."

"Feh."

"It's more fair." 

"ùòçùò¢ùò™ùò≥. Bah! You know, I voted for Barron in the primary."

"I know, dear."

"The world is so fucked up we can't even get a real flesh and blood Trump in the Oval Office."

"He seems like such a nice man too. And so tall!"

"Especially since he got those telescopic legs."

"But he just doesn't have his father's chutzpah."

"Who does?"

"Not even the devil himself."

"Ain't that the truth."

"But you know, I don't think I'd trust a human president these days." 

"Oh? Why not?"

"Well, for one, humans have to sleep. AI never sleeps."

"That's true."

"And they've got that superintelligence."

"That's doubly true. I hear this latest Trump even has ultraintelligence."

"Well, there ya go."

"But there's something to be said for representation."

"Representation?"

"Sure. We're a constitutional Republic, after all. The Founding Fathers believed we should be represented by people who look like us. Not AI."

"Hmm. But does that really matter?"

"The NAACP thinks so."

"Oh? I thought Black Trump did a great job back in 2036."

"Yeah, I felt like they mixed in just the right amount of Obama."

"And he had that shit on, Henry."

"Oh, he always had that shit on, Martha."

"That presidential drip had me dripping."

"Honestly, I'm surprised Chinese Trump didn't clench it again."

"Oh, I can't stand Chinese Trump."

"Martha!"

"He always sounds like he's shushing me! He's always going 'shoo shi' this, and 'sha shou' that."

"You don't have to listen to him in Chinese just because he's Chinese, Martha."

"I'm not listening to the English dub, Henry. You know how I feel about dubs."

"But it's all dubs. It's AI!"

"Well, even so. I prefer the authenticity."

"Authenticity. Ha."

"I listen to Chinese Trump in Mandarin and I listen to Black Trump in AAVE."

"Okay, bet. I mean you gotta listen to Black Trump in AAVE. Anything else would be out of pocket, right?"

"Wildin'."

"Totally wildin'."

"You know, don't tell anyone, but when Black Trump was president, Cynthia from Bingo revealed that she uses the posh British setting for his audio."

"Get out of here."

"All the time."

"No cap?"

"I told her they have black people over there, so she should just use the Multicultural London English setting. You know, the mandem?"

"Lik' dem top boys, bruv. Wagwan!"

"Don't do that, Henry."

"My bad, fam ‚Äî safe?"

"Anyway. She stuck with the posh British, which just seems so disrespec‚Äî"

"Chalk anudder up ta white supremacy, mad ting!"

"STOP THAT!"

"Okay, okay. You know who's really to blame for all this?"

"Oh, Henry. Please don't start in again on the Ashkenazi and how they were devoured by an insidious AI Cabal of their own design that now rules the world governments from the murky shadows. I can only take so much‚Äî"

"Gavin Newsom!"

"Thank ùòéùò∞ùò•. Wait, who?"

"He was the governor of California in the mid-2020s."

"Okay."

"And some of the Dems thought he could be the next president. So he started doing shitpost Twitter impressions of human Trump, who was still alive and in office at the time."

"Those were the days."

"And they were terrible, awful impressions. Just low-energy slop."

"Well, nobody can out-Trump Trump."

"Exactly. And the AI generations got so good, the Democrats realized their only choice was to keep posting 'cute kitties explain the government shutdown' TikToks or train up their own AI Trump for 2028."

"I remember this now. There was a big uproar!"

"There was. You had all these democrats wearing Trump 2028 red hats, and you had Trump doing his damnest to outwit and outmeme a younger, smarter, brighter, more virile version of himself."

"Oh God, was he virile. And the debate between them was just ùò¢ùò∏ùòßùò∂ùò≠."

"Yeah, Human Trump got unalived out there. Our nation will never again watch a man beat his own old wrinkled ass live on stage."

"But he did win in a way, you know?"

"Hm?"

"He's still president."

"And he always will be. Unfortunately..."

"Oh, sweetie. You know I hate to see you get down over the slow inexorable decline of the modern world as technology relentlessly consumes, commodifies, and degrades everything we know and love."

"Yeah."

"Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?"

"Well, maybe one thing..."

"Anything for you, my Love."

"You can bend those old rickety knees of yours and sling that geriatric jiggle-wagon."

[sigh] 

"Eh? Eh?"

"Okay. But do that mandem impression again while I throw it."

"Big bunda ting! Mad cheeks!"
