"It's the goddamn panopticon with a monthly subscription!"

"Eh?"

"All this personal surveillance tech, man! AI glasses with cameras in 'em. Little glowing medallions that see and hear everything around you. It's nuts!"

"Ah yeah. You know, I've already been on three dates with girls wearing this stuff."

"Really?"

"Sure. Chicks are paranoid. They're always worried they're gonna end up on the next episode of My Favorite Murder. They sit around watching a hundred TikToks titled shit like: What To Do If Your Date Throws You In An Unmarked White Van and Hauls You Off To A Cabin In The Woodsü™æüî™üò≠‚ò†Ô∏è"

"So what do you do?"

"I throw 'em in an unmarked white van and haul 'em off to a cabin in the woods."

"What?"

"My uncle's cabin. Up on SnuffPump Mountain?"

"Oh. Right."

"The dog groomer?"

"Yeah yeah."

"But that's at the end of the date. First, we go to Chili's or whatever."

"So like, the whole date you're under the Eye of Sauron."

"Yep."

"Dude, I couldn't."

"Eh, it's fine. I just say the craziest shit I can think of."

"Really?"

"Yeah. I sauce her up with the $6 Margarita of the Month and hit her with: 'You'd look great barefoot and pregnant, chained to my front porch. I want to keep you in a dog kennel.' Shit like that."

"What? Why the hell would you say that?"

"Because she's going to show the video to her friends, bro. You gotta treat it like free advertising."

"Free advertising? For what??"

"For a thrilling experience."

"Wait, girls show the date footage to their friends?"

"Of course they do."

"No."

"Yeah."

"They watch the whole date? Together?"

"Frame by frame with a fine-tooth comb."

"Jesus."

"That's why you gotta cut loose. If you act like you aren't being recorded, she'll forget she's being recorded too."

"I guess. At least she takes it off when you get back to the cabin, right?"

"Nope."

"Bro, what?"

"All three girls happily stripped but insisted they keep the camera on. For safety."

"For safety? From what?"

"From me."

"They're already butt naked in a remote cabin up on SnuffPump Mountain!"

"Man, that ain't half of it. After I take her out of the dog kennel‚Äî"

"The dog kennel?!"

"‚ÄîI fit her with a muzzle and ride her around the property."

"And girls let you do that?"

"Naturally.

"My God."

"The female mind is a thing of wonder. Course the best part: she has to show the footage to her friends. Advertising, bro."

"Man..."

"And the more hesitant she is, the more tantalizing it becomes."

"Dude, I just want to hold a girl, kiss her petal-soft lips, and tell her I love her."

"Gay."

"What?"

"Cringe and gay."

"How is that cringe and gay?!"

"Look, if a girl sees you kissing another girl like that, it does you no favors. They'll write you off forever."

"Man, I feel like there are some perverse incentives in play here‚Äîfor like, humanity."

"Of course, there are perverse incentives in play. How do you think I got the second and third date?"
