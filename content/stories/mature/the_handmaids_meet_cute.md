In the main hall at Union Station, a National Guardsman scratches his chin. "And this isn't a kink thing?"

"No," the bespectacled woman in the red cloak and white bonnet scowls. "It's not a kink thing."

"It's on Hulu," her younger friend chimes, standing beside in matching attire.

"Okay, so let me see if I got this straight." The Guardsman clears his throat. "All the fertile women—"

"Breeding age!" The bespectacled woman corrects.

"All the 𝘣𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘨𝘦 women are forced into these red mennonite farm girl outfits..."

"That's right."

"...and they have to lie between the legs of the wife, who is 𝘯𝘰𝘵 breeding age—"

"Well, no, she is," the younger woman clarifies. "But she's infertile."

The guardsman blinks. "Why's she infertile?"

"The tyrants of Gilead claim it's because of female sinfulness, but the story implies the cause is a systemic issue in the environment, like pollution or nuclear radiation or ecological collapse."

"They never specify?"

"No. I mean, I don't think so."

The guardsman snorts. "Well that's lazy world-building, isn't it?"

"Ha. I guess." The younger woman pushes a stray blonde strand over her ear. 

"The point—" the bespectacled woman interjects "—is that she's on the bed!"

"Okay, okay." The guardsman nods. "So she's between the legs of the infertile wife, who holds her by the hands—"

"The wrists!"

"By the wrists, as the husband—"

"The Commander!"

"Who's a very stern and very rich and very powerful member of the highest stratum of men in Gilead," the younger woman chimes.

The guardsman flicks his eyes between the pair. "Is that it?"

They nod.

"—bangs her."

"Well, that's a crass way to put it." The bespectacled woman frowns. "But yes, the wife holds the Handmaiden's wrists and the Commander solemnly copulates with her to claim the womb and sire a child."

The guardsman pinches his brow. "And this isn't a kink thing?"

"No!" The women huff.

The guardsman shakes his head  "I don't know, ladies. I'm sure it's a nice show and all, but that seems like a lot of work."

"A lot of work?" The bespectacled woman bristles. "What do you mean a lot of work?"

"The whole wife-wrist-bed-thing and the forced chores with the Amish LARP."

"LARP?!" The bespectacled woman shrills. "It's based on the trials and tribulations of real women across the world! Across history!"

"Okay sure, but couldn't they just keep them all in a shipping container?"

The younger woman gasps.

"A shipping container?!" The bespectacled woman splutters.

"Or like a correctional facility or something?" The guardsman limply offers.

The bespectacled woman scowls, jabbing a finger. "You'd like that, wouldn't you? That's what you've been dreaming about this whole time!"

"No..."

"Ways to keep us! Ways to enslave us!"

"No, I don't—"

The bespectacled woman turns, shouting at the passing travelers. "THEY INTEND TO SHACKLE AND IMPRISON US! TO FORCEFULLY BREED OUR FERTILE WOMBS, TO RENDER US SWOLLEN AND GRAVID IN HEAVY CHAINS, JUST AS WE WARNED ALL ALONG!"

A trio of frightened Chinese tourists yelp and scurry away.

"Hey, hey!" The guardsman hoarsely whispers. "I'm not looking to shackle or chain anyone, okay lady? I'm just here to keep the peace."

"So you claim."

"I don't sit around thinking up ways to enslave women, alright?"

"Yes, and the fact you don't just shows how little you care 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 women!"

"Wha—'

"This isn't a fanboy Disney franchise you can shoot off half-cocked theories about on some backwoods subreddit." The bespectacled woman lifts her chin. "The Handmaid's Tale is a prophetic vision, a warning of the grisly fate that is certain to befall all women if we do not remain ever vigilant!"

"With 6 seasons on Hulu," the younger woman chimes.

"Six seasons, good God," the Guardsman says. "So when does she grow the tail?"

The pair blinks.

"Tail?" The bespectacled woman asks. "What tail?"

"Does she turn into like a mutant rat woman in season 3?"

The younger woman pinches her lips.

"Mutant rat woman?" The bespectacled woman scowls. "What are you on about?"

"Well, you guys said it was a post-apocalypse with nuclear radiation..."

"Yes..."

"And it's called The Handmaid's Tail, so she must grow it at some point."

The younger woman tugs the side of her bonnet to block her face.

"You! You're mocking us!" The bespectacled woman fumes. 

The guardsman lifts his hands. "Lady, I'm just trying to understand—"

"Well, go ahead and mock us! Despite your best efforts, we women are still free citizens! And we don't have to take this disrespect!" The bespectacled woman pivots on her heels and storms away. "Mary, let's go!"

"Coming!" The younger woman calls.

"Mary huh?" The guardsman tilts his head. "I'm Jake."

Mary works the crooked smile off her face. "You don't really think there's a tail, do you, Jake?" 

"Nah." Jake shrugs. "I've seen like two seasons. And read the book."

"Hmph. So you really were playing with us..."

"You have to admit, it sounds like a kink."

"You keep saying that. I guess you're just that kind of guy..." Mary off-handedly ventures.

"What kind of guy?

She levels her gaze. "The kind who thinks holding a girl's wrists constitutes a kink."

"It can." Jake diplomatically states. "But I don't think my wife would be into it."

"Oh." Mary's face falls. 

"Or the threesome."

"You have a wife..."

"Nah, but you could audition for the part."

Mary falters, caught off guard. "Wha—"

"Mary!" The bespectacled woman calls from across the lobby.

"Unless you're too busy playing  handmaiden." Jake flashes a smirk.

Mary scoffs. "Now that's a forward way to ask."

"Is it?" Jake ponders aloud. "Aren't you the one in the fetish gear, rattling off your depraved fantasies to a stranger in a train station?"

"Oh?" Mary crosses her arms. "Do I offend you?"

"As a matter of fact, you do."

Mary squints, scrutinizing his face. "I can never tell when you're serious."

"Then I'll ask a serious question."

"Okay." Mary braces.

"Mary!"

"Have you read the Blind Assassin?"

"No."  Mary suppresses a smirk. " Is that by Atwood too?"

"Bah!" The bespectacled woman throws up her hands and storms off.

"It is," Jake says. "And it's a damn good book."

"Oh?" Despite Mary's best efforts, the smile rises anyway. "How good is it?"

"You're a modern woman aren't you?"

"I am," Mary defiantly declares.

"Well then." Jake grins. "Buy me a coffee and I'll tell you all about it."
