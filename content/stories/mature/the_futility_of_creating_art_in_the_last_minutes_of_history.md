Bro, bro. You gotta see this!"

"Eh?"

"I've made Art."

[sigh] "Again?"

"You're gonna love it, man. Check it out!"

"More impasto acrylic paintings of 1920s French fishermen? Really?"

"Uh huh."

"Didn't you already generate a hundred of these?" 

"Ten thousand this week, actually. But this one's different. See?"

"...because it's animated?"

"Yep! Watch how the water crests like an ocean wave over the bow, but still moves like paint."

"Wow."

"Wow? That's all I get? A sarcastic, half-hearted wow? Where's your Sense of Wonder?"

"Oh, it's here alright."

"Is it?"

"Yeah. I'm wondering how many tubes of prescription 1.1.% sodium fluoride you had to guzzle as a kid to lose enough IQ points to find this drek moderately engaging—"

"Hey."

"—let alone enthralling."

"Didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to insult an Artist's work?"

"An Artist. Ha."

"I am an Artist! I spent a lot of time on this."

"In the same way a 50-year-old with grade 3 hemorrhoids and a severe fiber deficiency spends a lot of time on the can, sure."

"Oh, I get it. You're just a hater because I've started using the most advanced tools ever created by man to bring my creative vision to life."

"Your creative vision? Bro, your creative vision is the AI-simulated equivalent of elementary school Arts and Crafts pour painting without the fun of doing actual Arts and Crafts pour painting."

"Yep, see, just a hater. That's why people like me will be the intellectually-augmented, recursively-self-improving transhuman aesthetes of the post-biological future, and people like you will be nothing more than grunting paleolithic neanderthals smearing dog shit stick figures on some dimly-lit cave wall with your feeble human fingers."

"Au contraire, mon frere. This meat-ware primitive has a few tricks up his mammoth-hide sleeve. Behold."

"Huh?"

"My Patreon page."

"Your Patreon page? For what?"

"For Art."

"Whoa, whoa, hold on. I didn't know you were an Artist."

"I'm not. I used Grok to search for all the big-name NSFW Artists on X with more than 250k followers, scraped all their posts, trained LoRAs on each of their signature styles that they spent years of their lives slaving away to develop—"

"Uh."

"—and then set up copycat X accounts that use an automated workflow to generate a fresh piece of premium goonerbait and post it on the hour, every hour."

"...aaand then you have a Patreon for each one of these copycat X accounts?"

"Oui, mon ami idiot obsédé par l’IA."

"Wow. And the artists are okay with this?"

"What? Hell no! Are you kidding me?"

"Um."

"They 𝘩𝘢𝘵𝘦 my ass."

"Okay." 

"Look, not only can I crank out more goonerbait garbage in a day than they can hope to put out in a decade, I can cater to any kink on the planet."

"Kink?"

"Sure, look, Artists are real people, right?"

"They used to be..."

"Which means they have all kinds of consent limits and sexual orientations and pesky moral objections. And I don't have any of that shit, so I can generate all the dark, deranged depravity the people really crave."

"Jesus."

"And feet stuff. A lot of requests for feet stuff."

"I don't know, man, this seems so..."

"I'm gonna be honest: it's 90% feet stuff."

"Exploitative?"

"Exploitative? Meh."

"Why would you do this?"

"Because I make $3-6000 a month?"

"Whoa."

"Per Patreon page."

"Uh, and how many pages do you have?"

"Twelve. And counting."

"Twelve? That's like...half a million a year? More?"

"The ARR is juicy, my friend. Like freshly-generated BBW anime girl thigh."

"Do you, uh..."

"Hm?"

"Do you think I could put some of these foot fetish anime gooner girls in my French fishermen boats?"

"I don't see why not."

"And more importantly, do you think people would pay for it?'

"If you swiped a popular style, sure."

"Nice."

"But you know there's a clock running on all this, right?"

"A clock?"

"Yeah, the AI Gooner Gold Rush is the same as any other gold rush. Inevitably, the market saturates, and demand dries up."

"Oh."

"And by that point, the real human artists will probably have all given up and quit in seething disgust."

"𝘖𝘩. Well, I feel kind of bad about that."

"Meh."

"Don't you?"

"Nah, I hate gooners."

"Damn."

"The Bible says a fool and his foot fetish dollars are quickly parted."

"Even so, it kind of feels like you're killing Art as a whole, doesn't it?"

"Killing Art as a whole? Bro, I just told you, it's all gooner shit."

"You know what I mean. Like you said, these Artists spent years of their lives learning to draw."

"Huh. Well, hey. Look at it this way."

"Hm?"

"Think of it as just playing your small role in a great performance piece."

"A great performance piece?"

"Sure. The greatest performance piece the world has ever seen, starring you and me and all the AI scrapers and all the Artists, all working together."

"Together?"

"Yep. A piece about man's endless drive to goon against the dying light. We can call it: The Futility of Creating Art in the Last Minutes of History."

"Wow."

"Like that?"

"Yeah, I do. I do! It sounds like Art!"

"Feel better now?"

"Uh huh."

"Great. Let's get your Patreon set up."

"Sure, sure. As long as I get to be an Artist."
