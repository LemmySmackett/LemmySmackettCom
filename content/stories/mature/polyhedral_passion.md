"What's wrong, Dodecahedron-chan? You seem distant."

"...do you love me, Jake-kun?"

"What? Of course I love you!"

"Hmm."

"Where's this coming from?"

"I saw what's on your phone."

"Oh."

"..."

"I'm sure that was just a pop-up. Or an ad! Those thunder-thigh GILFs on AZNGrannySquat dot com mean nothing to me!"

"That wasn't the site I saw, Jake-kun."

"...oh."

"It was Wolfram Mathworld."

"......oh."

"Be honest, Jake-kun. Are you bipyramid curious?

"Dodecahedron-chan!"

"It's okay if you are."

"I'd never!"

"Everybody's a little bi-curious."

"Honest!"

"I saw you looking up Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra—

"I wouldn't—"

"—in backless virgin killer sweaters."

"Ugh."

"And that was just the start. I never realized you were into shapes with such...complicated sides."

"Dodecahedron-chan, please."

"Asymmetrical. Oblique. Stellated."

"..."

"While all my sides are symmetrical. Equilateral. Balanced."

"..."

"And boring."

"Dodecahedron-chan, listen."

"..."

"I love your sides. All of them."

"Even if they're all the same?"

"Yes. You'll always be my prurient polyhedron of pentagonal passion."

"...really?"

"Really."

"You're not being acute with me?"

"With a shape as obtuse as you? Never."

"Oh, Jake-kun!"

"Dodecahedron-chan!"

"After my sister got dumped for a cone, I was so scared you were bored of me!"

"I mean, your sister is a little flat."

"What."

"Uuh."

"Of course she's flat. She's six-sided."

"Right."

"Were you really looking at my sister that way?"

"N-no! I'd never be into a girl with less than ten sides!"

"Hm."

"Swear to God!"

"Oh, whatever. I've been poly-ovulating all morning. Take me, Jake-kun. Make me your Isohedral of Submission!"

"Yeah! Bend over, you twelve-sided slut!"
