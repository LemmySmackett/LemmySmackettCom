Fourteen-year-old Billy Blackerby runs to the kitchen.

"Mom! MOM!"

"Ugh. What is it now, Billy?"

"It turns out my weirdness is actually hidden magic that can transport us to a world where magic can run free!"

"You said magic twice."

"Mom, look!" He gestures over his shoulder. "I just made a portal!"

A churning swirl of purple light hovers over a Jakobsfors Ikea coffee table.

"In the living room, Billy? Really? I just ran the Roomba."

"Mom, come on! This is our opportunity to go on an exhilarating adventure through a strange and whimsical land that challenges us to work together and grow as people, while also learning to accept one another for who we are—"

"Billy."

"—culminating in a tear-jerker finale where I sacrifice my newfound, unfathomable powers so we can go back to the real world, returning to the status quo and thereby completing the Hero's Journey—"

"Billy."

"—because the real magic isn't flashy spells and the ability to summon a forty-foot demon named Belial, the living, self-destructive personification of my hormonal wrath and all my wretched feelings of adolescent ineptitude, it's family."

"Billy, I'm surrendering you to CPS."

"What?"

"They'll be here in fifteen minutes."

"What?! Mom!'

"Sorry, Billy."

 "Why would you do that?!"

"Because you keep skipping school, you waterboarded the neighbor's cat, and you cut the brake lines on my new boyfriend's car."

"In my defense, Todd's a dick."

"Also, I'm pretty sure you're the Anti-Christ."

"The Anti-Christ?!"

"I slept with a half-goat man at a crossroads while backpacking through Nepal."

"What?"

"In my defense, I was 19."

"Okay, well, well, well fuck you, slut!" Billy shouts through tears. "I'm going with Belial!"

Billy hops in the portal, which immediately evaporates in a burst of flame.

His mom sighs. "Teenagers."
