Linda covers her mouth in horror. "Oh my God."

Her Tatted-up Clown BF—Binky "Big Time" Inksplat—proudly displays his new barber pole dick tattoo: "What ya think?"

Linda sighs. "It's very you, dear."

"Right? Doodles the Fool was offering a BOGO deal down at the shop. Can you believe it?"

"Doodles the Fool offers a lot of BOGO deals down at the shop," Linda mutters with a thin smile.

"Touch it."

She reaches out. "Sweetie, do you ever feel like we're losing the romanc-"

"Linda, wha-" The flying fowl bounces off his head.

"I SAID GET THE FUCK OUT, YOU RED-NOSED RETARD!"
