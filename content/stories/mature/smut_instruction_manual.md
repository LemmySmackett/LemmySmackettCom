Hey man, how's the smut?"

"This isn't smut."

"Ah, sorry, how's the 20th-century Russian sociopolitical fantasy-satire with the sinewy bare-chested werewolf in low-rise hip huggers on the front cover?"

"Okay, it is smut. But I'm not reading it for titillation."

"Right, yeah, I've heard there are a lot of compelling character arcs and intricate Pynchonian plot developments in, let's see here, The Werewolf's Broodmate: Packed by the Pack."

"I'm reading—"

"By Fanny Rhyder."

"I'm reading it—"

"I was always more of an Ophelia Cox fan myself."

"Do you mind?"

"Is the devil followed by a giant sarcastic tomcat who loves pistols, vodka, and chess?"

"I'm reading it as an instruction manual."

"Right, in case you ever need to kidnap an ambitious, strong-willed greeting card marketing executive and drag her kicking and screaming deep into the verdant, moss-choked forests of the Blue Ridge Mountains—"

"That's..."

"—so you can shackle her to a damp, limestone wall as your unwilling-but-not-unyielding prisoner of passion in a secluded, bone-littered cave."

"...very specific. And accurate. And specific."

"I used to do a little roleplay on VRChat."

"Well, joke all you want but we can learn a lot from erotica."

"Right, like how to do a solid 5-to-10 in a medium-security prison and end up on the National Sex Offender Registry."

"I'm serious! I've gone through twenty of these books and I'm seeing The Pattern."

"Reading the why-choose heat-heavy HEA tea leaves."

"These girls all start out as prisoners but they 𝘣𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘦 the warden."

"The classic cum-slave-cum-cum-queen gambit." 

"I've realized that every woman is simply looking for her own beast to tame. A feral, barely-human, animal-of-a-man that is brought to heel by his own ravenous passion—for her. And her alone."

"And that's why every time I'm on a date, I kick it off with an ear-splitting moonward howl—"

"Women want to enslave and be enslaved—by love."

"—and piss all over the leg of my date's barstool chair."

"..."

"To claim ownership."

"Frankly, I don't know how any woman could tame you. How the hell are you married?"

"I do weighted barbell hip thrusts three times a week and look great in a pair of handcuffs." 

"Forget I asked. Anyway, I'm confident that I've learned all that smut can teach me. I'm ready to go out and find True Love."

"Our sleaze-addled, smut-brained Casanova."

"There's really only one question left."

"What's that, Cas?"

"How to develop clinical lycanthropy."
