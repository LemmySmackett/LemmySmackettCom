Bro, you look so refreshed."

"I 𝘧𝘦𝘦𝘭 refreshed."

"Well whatever you're doing, it's working. New skincare routine?"

"Nah, I started rawdogging for 1 hour every day."

"Oh, nice. I also like to rawdog every day. Don't always get the opportunity but—"

"You gotta make the opportunity, bro."

"True, true, everything's a numbers game. Even then, I'm not sure I could last a whole hour."

"I find the first ten minutes are a real struggle, but the trick is to just clear your mind and let your thoughts flow. 

"Huh."

"Like water."

"I always think about Baseball."

[sigh] "To stop the flowing?"

"Uh huh."

"I'm beginning to suspect your rawdogging isn't my rawdogging."

"I don't know. Sometimes when I'm hitting it just right I do enter a sort of trance-like, meditative state—"

"Uh huh." 

"—but it only lasts for about thirty seconds."

"Okay well, real rawdogging is an observational practice of stillness."

"Real rawdogging?"

"Like Zazen."

"Now hold on. There's only one real rawdogging, dawg, and it's when you stick your dog in raw."

"Sure, if you are the dog and the rawness is base reality unmediated by the omnipresent cognition-corroding ad-driven attention-extracting technological substrate of modern life."

"Yeah. I'd rather just nut."

"The point is you can't rawdog while you rawdog."

"Well, unless you're Mormon, of course."

"Huh?"

"I've heard that Mormons circumvent the Church's prohibition on pre-marital sex by Soaking—a practice where the man inserts into the woman and they proceed to lie motionless for the duration of the act."

"What? That's just some dumb TikTok rumor."

"The point is a man could hypothetically rawdog while he rawdogs."

"Well..."

"Am I wrong?"

"Rawdogging isn't really a two-person practice. Traditionally speaking."

"Why not? People meditate together in temples and dojos across this great nation every day, don't they?"

[sigh] "Okay sure. Ten or twenty people could all go down to their nearest strip mall mcdojo and rawdog together."

"𝘞𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘦 rawdogging each other."

"Yes, okay, fine. If they're all unwed Mormons, ten or twenty people could go down to the nearest strip mall McDojo and rawdog together while rawdogging each other. Happy now?"

"I am."

"Was this a good use of your time?"

"Eh, I'd rather be rawdogging."
