In 1999, on the remote Caribbean island of Little Saint James, Jeffrey Epstein reclines in a palatial hall, perched on a throne of gold. Wealth clutters the walls: jeweled trinkets fresh from auction, gilt-framed portraits of powdered nobles, art bought but never loved.

"Can't believe I've finally got my own throne room on my own private island!" Epstein chuckles to himself. "God, I love being a famous New York financier. Almost as much as I love—"

A nearby VSAT intercom buzzes. "Jeffrey."

Epstein beams. "Hello, Ghislaine. How's Manhattan?"

"Donald's here to see you."

Epstein's smile slips. "What?"

"Donald's—"

"Send him away!" Epstein shouts. "God, that guy's such a blowhard."

"I can't send him away."

"Why not? Just kick him out of the office."

"Jeff—"

"Call security if you need. I'd love to see that toupee'd twat hauled out."

"He's not here-here, Jeffrey."

"What?"

"He's there-here."

"...what?"

"He's on the island."

"Uh."

"With you."

"Come again."

"Security cameras spotted Donald on the docks fifteen minutes ago."

Epstein stares at the intercom. "...are you fucking with me, Ghislaine?"

"I am not fucking with you, Jeffrey."

"We're on a private island in the Caribbean! An island that can only be reached by boat or helicopter!"

"I know."

"How can he—"

The ornate double doors of the palatial hall slam open. "JEFFREY!"

Epstein jumps in his seat. "Donald!"

Real estate mogul and Home Alone 2 star Donald Trump strolls in. "It's a cute little place you got here, Jeff. A cute little place."

"Donald, how—"

"Sloppy work on the marble in the garden though. Sloppy, sloppy stuff. If those were my contractors, that wouldn't happen."

"Donald!"

"Hm?

"How did you get here?"

Trump shrugs. "I walked."

Epstein leans forward. "To the 𝘪𝘴𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘥."

"I flew."

Epstein stares. "...Donald you're wearing a wetsuit."

"Hm?" Trump glances down. He's clad in full-body matte-black trilaminate with sealed seams and latex cuffs, his belt and harness clipped with fins, a tactical knife, and a Draeger LAR-V rebreather. "Oh, this old thing?" Trump says. "It's actually a 𝘥𝘳𝘺suit."

"A drysuit?"

"New fitness craze on the mainland," Trump explains. "Supposed to be very slimming." He turns, showing off his figure in a nearby wall-length mirror. "What do you think?"

"I think it looks like a 𝘣𝘭𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘰𝘱𝘴 drysuit."

"Eh?"

"The kind of black ops drysuit worn by a man paid by the FBI to infiltrate my private island via an SDV mini-sub launched from a United States nuclear submarine."

"Does it now?" Trump admires his own ass in the mirror.

"Yes." Epstein's jaw tightens. "It does."

"Well, I wouldn't know about all that."

"Really."

"Truth told, the whole outfit was Melanie's idea."

"Melanie?" Epstein furrows his brow.

"She insisted I wear it."

"Who's Melanie?"

"A model."

"Ah."

"Nice girl. Tall. Slovenian. Brunette, but nobody's perfect."

"Donald."

"I met her at fashion week."

"Donald, why are you here?"

"Well I happened to be in the area—"

"In the area," Epstein deadpans.

"—and I thought I'd drop by. Have a couple of laughs."

"Right."

Trump wanders around the room, glancing at baroque paintings and marble busts. "So what do you do for fun around here, Jeff? Besides buying all these baubles."

Epstein crosses his arms. "You tell me."

"Nothing huh?" Trump grins. "Don't be ashamed, Jeff. A lot of fellas go broke buying their first island. Is this from Sotheby's?" He points at a painting. "A lot of counterfeits going around."

"It's real," Epstein sighs. "And I'm not broke, Donald. This island has three private beaches."

"Yeah, but it's an island, right? Those come with the place."

Epstein pinches his lips. "There's also two Olympic size pools."

"Ah right, for when you get tired of swimming in the ocean all day."

Epstein's ears glow red. "There's also a gym with full amenities. And a Tiki Hut!"

"Oh wow, a Tiki Hut," Trump marvels.

Epstein leaps out of his seat. "And a library and a cinema with stadium seating and balneário japonês!"

Trump looks over. "A baloney jap what?"

"A spa!" Epstein shouts. "A Japanese-style spa!"

"Ah, a spa."

Epstein flops back on the throne, fuming. "Fucking blowhard..." he mutters under his breath.

Trump wanders closer. "You spend a lot of time in the spa, Jeffrey?" 

"What?"

"Getting 𝘮𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴." Trump lazily locks eyes with the financier.

Epstein glares back. "...no."

"No?" Trump tilts his head. "Really?"

"Really."

"Huh. That's surprising."

"Why is that surprising?"

Trump shrugs. "I just figured you'd be getting massages all the time."

Epstein clenches his teeth. "Why would I be getting massages all the time, Donald?"

"Because swimming in three beaches and two pools sounds exhausting."

"..."

"I'd definitely need a massage after all that."

"Yeah, well I don't."

"Never?" Trump innocently asks.

"Never."

"Really?"

"Never!" Epstein spits. "I never get massages!"

Trump snorts. "You're a weird guy, Jeff."

"How am I a weird guy?!"

"You got your own private island with your own private spa and you don't even use it."

The men stare each other down. Trump blithely grins the whole time.

"It's for guests," Epstein finally says.

"Ah." Trump nods. "Guests." 

Epstein straightens his collar. "Now, Donald, it's been a lovely visit but I think it's time for you to—"

"I'm a guest."

Epstein blinks. "What?"

"I'm a guest," Trump says. "On your island."

"So?"

"The spa is for guests." Trump tilts his head. "Right?" 

"..."

"..."

Epstein emits a defeated sigh. "Yes, Donald. The spa is for guests."

"Great." Trump claps his hands. "Let's see it."

With an air of weary resignation, Epstein rises from his throne. "Fine."

"Wonderful! I always knew you were good for a laugh, Jeff."

"I bet."

"Now tell me." Trump walks up and throws his arm around Epstein's shoulder. "Who's your masseuse?"
