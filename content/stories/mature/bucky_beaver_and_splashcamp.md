"Man, Calculus II is killing me. It's like I'm being waterboarded at Abu Ghraib." 

"Or SplashCamp."

"SplashCamp?"

"It's a Twitter/X thing."

"Where they waterboard each other?"

"Yeah, so there used to be a yearly event called VibeCamp where people would pay hundreds of dollars to show up in Texas and stare at niche internet micro-celebrities, like a bunch of lemurs."

"Okay..."

"And that inspired a bunch of spin-off Camps, each hosted by different people, and at one of these Camps, everyone decided to waterboard each other."

"The fuck? Why?"

"You can just do things."

"I guess."

"Anyway, people loved getting waterboarded so much they ended all the other Camps and re-consolidated everything back under SplashCamp."

"Where they waterboard each other."

"Uh-huh."

"And nothing else."

"It lasts for three days."

"Is this a weird sex thing?"

"No. I mean, it's mostly single guys who show up hoping to get laid, but then they just get waterboarded."

"Average bachelor experience."

"Anyway, if you're struggling with Calculus, you should use Grok."

"I'm actually trying to learn this shit man, not cheat."

"It's not cheating! I've used the companion mode to study for years. Here check it out."

"Uh, why is your AI companion an anthropomorphic talking beaver?"

"I told you, I've had him for years. His name's Bucky."

"Dude, are you a furry? Is this a weird sex thing?"

"No, God. Why is everything a weird sex thing with you?"

"I live under the Sepulchral Gloom of the Internet, a miasma of rot that rolls unceasing across this virgin world, corroding all that is pure under heaven with its vile, fetid touch."

"Okay Baudelaire, just give me a Calc problem you're struggling with."

"Alright, uh...this one."

"So to start, I'm gonna have Bucky give us the answer. We just paste the problem aaand go."

"There you go. Now you can drill in and ask any questions as needed."

"Not bad. The beaver is still pretty cringe though."

"Whatever, the point is he can help us find any expressions we need. Isn't that right, Bucky?"

"Not a weird sex thing, huh?"

"Hey, at least I'm not into being waterboarded."
