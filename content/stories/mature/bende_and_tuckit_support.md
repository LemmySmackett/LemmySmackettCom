"Hello, you've reached the technical support line for Bende & TuckIt, a subsidiary of Absolute Assurance Shanzhai. This is David speaking. Please state your name and the product you're calling about today."

"Uh, hi, I'm Cheryl. Cheryl Carlyle."

"Hello, Cheryl. What product may I help you with?"

"Oh, sorry. I own the Tuck Duo."

"Ah, our prehensile bedside clothes-folding robotic-arm-lamps—a cutting-edge Bende & TuckIt all-original innovation which is definitely not manufactured in grey market shadow factories based out of Shenzen, China."

"Er, yes that."

"What seems to be the problem?"

"Well, it's a bit embarrassing..."

"You can tell me anything, ma'am. Whatever you say on this line is protected by Consumer-Representative Privilege"

"Oh. Really?"

"Yes ma'am. I'm a highly-trained minimum-wage professional based in [𝗖𝗢𝗨𝗚𝗛], USA. I can't be compelled to divulge any information you reveal, unless my boss threatens to cut my hours or take away my smoke break."

"That's a relief. Well, recently there was an update."

"The Massage Update."

"Yes, that."

"Did you follow the instructions closely and let the Tuck Duo do a full reboot?"

"I did. But then the oddest thing happened."

"Go on."

"Well, after my husband left for work, I had the Tuck Duo fold his laundry and then I decided to try the new Shiatsu mode."

"Naturally. At Bende & TuckIt, we believe every housewife deserves a treat."

"Yes, but as soon as I hit the button, the Tuck Duo pulled me onto the bed, yanked my hair, and slapped my butt!"

"O-oh."

"And then it went on spanking me—"

"Oh my God."

"—for the next five minutes!"

"Ma'am, that's—I am so sorry that happened."

"Thank you. It was so confusing. And very distressing!"

"I believe it. Where is the Tuck Duo now? Did you unplug it?

"Well, I thought it might have been a glitch, you know? Maybe something I did wrong..."

"Ma'am..."

"So I tried Shiatsu Mode the next day and it happened again!"

"Ma'am, if your Tuck Duo is malfunctioning, I must insist you refrain from using it."

"Okay."

"If you prefer, I can start the process for a return or replacement right now."

"Well, actually I had a question. About the massage settings."

"Go ahead."

"So like I said, it pulled my hair and spanked me. Truth told, it's been happening every morning, for about a week now."

"Ma'am, I must reiterate that you should not use a malfunctioning device. User safety is of utmost importance and we here at Bende & TuckIt would never—"

"Do you think it could choke me?"

"..."

"..."

"...come again?"

"The Tuck Duo. Do you think it could wrap those long, cold, synthetic claws—"

"Uh."

"—around my soft, slender throat—"

"Uuuh."

"—and clamp down with a rough, tight squeeze."

"Ma'am."

"Maybe get a good blood choke going."

"Ma'am, I must strongly insist that you do 𝘯𝘰𝘵 turn the Tuck Duo on, and you do 𝘯𝘰𝘵 use the Shiatsu setting, and you do 𝘯𝘰𝘵 let it blood choke you."

"So that's no then?"

"The Tuck Duo is designed to fold clothes and assist with chores. It's not meant to—"

"Maybe you could put it in the next update."

"I'm sorry?"

"Call it the Throat Massage Update."

"Ma'am, we are not pushing an update for auto-erotic asphyxiation."

"Technically it's robo-erotic asphyxiation."

"Ma'am."

[Sigh] "Alright. Well, I don't want to do a return or a replacement. But I did have another request. For an Update."

"Okay..."

"I need you to remove the Prostate Massage setting."

"Prostate Massage? Ma'am, there's no—"

"I think my husband is cheating on me."
